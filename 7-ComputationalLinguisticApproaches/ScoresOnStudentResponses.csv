Student,Response,Analysis,Explanation,Critique,Advance ClaimA 1,"The flooding in Charleston is not caused by increased precipitation, but by all the land with impermeable surfaces, or man-made things like buildings or roads that will not let in water. Precipitation has increased over the years, but so has all the houses, roads, and so on because of the rising population. So along with the increased precipitation, the water does not get absorbed by the soil fast enough, which is how flooding starts. The meteorologistês argument was inaccurate because he didnêt include increased building. After looking at a graph of land changes in the area, the only thing that went up dramatically was the amount of impermeable surfaces in the area. Plus, the natural lands have gone down quickly between 2003 and 2013. This is supportive because water cannot be absorbed quickly if there is less natural land to absorb it. The only thing that could cause this is increased population, which has happened in Charleston for a while now. This is why the meteorologistês statement was inaccurate and why this statement is more accurate about the increased flooding in Charleston.   ",4,4,3,4A 2,"The Meteorologist would be incorrect, because the flooding is due to not having very many places for the water to go. There are too many things blocking the rainwater from going back in to the ground. The precipitation he said has increased had actually not increased but decreased over the years and then slowly started to increase again over the last year.  If there were less buildings or more drainage places Charleston wouldnêt be such a flooded area.  Charleston has always had a flooding problem, so just because the precipitation had decreased in 1983 and again in 1993 and started to increase again in 2005 doesnêt mean that there had never been a flooding problem, but maybe the meteorologist just never caught the flood.  ",2,3,3,1A 3,The cause of Charlestons flooding problems are due to increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces.  The local meteorologist is wrong that it is increased precipitation. It is the increase in populated areas on impermeable surfaces. It is not the increase in precipitation because the precipitation is the same as it was in 2013 as it as in 1963. But it has increased since 2003. The amount of rain didnêt cause flooding in 1963 because the amount of developed permeable surfaces was greater than the developed impermeable surfaces. Since the towns growth the developed impermeable surfaces has surpassed the developed permeable surfaces. Causing flooding because the land cannot cope with the amount of rain and not having a place to put it because all of the permeable land is less than the impermeable surfaces.,4,4,4,0A 4,"I think that Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increase in developed land areas  with impermeable surfaces because, different materials withstand water in different ways such as dirt and concrete, dirt is going to allow water to run through it where concreate is going to withhold water. With developed land areas needing drainage this means if the drainage was not large enough for the rain fall that had picked back up in 2005 that means there would be flooding.  Another problem would be where all the drainage would go; if there is no place for the drainage to go that could also cause flooding to. Different materials withhold and take in water  so if Charleston mainly has concreate as a foundation it is going to not soak it up that means the more it rains the more water is going to have to drain so no matter how much water you get it is still going to flood. Increased precipitation isnêt the problem because if you look at the chart the amount of precipitation was just as high in 1973 as it was in 2005 so they would have had the flooding problem long before then. If the drainage was not made large enough in 1993 when the precipitation rates were down that could also be a problem. No one can control Mother Nature it is going to do what it wants to do. So if the rain count went up that means the drainage would be backed up because it was not made for the amount of rain that the city is with taking. The biggest problem of all is where is all of the precipitation going to go? When water comes down it has to go somewhere such as here where we live most of the water runs through streams which lead to lakes and from the lakes it leads to rivers and from there the ocean. So if the city of Charleston does not have those things that mean the water is going to run all over that could be one of their biggest problems. so in this essay I wright why I think the meteorologist claim is incorrect because yes the amount of precipitation does matter but you have to think beyond the stuff falling out of the sky you have to think about drainage, types of materials in the area and where the water has to go once it has fallen.",4,4,4,3A 5,I think that Charleston had a good system to begin with but after all the rain and floods their system wouldnêt work right after having a big amount of water. Their system didnêt get use to that amount of water then it change after the fact of get the big amount of water and their system didnêt know how to go back to being normal. You can tell in graph 2 that the land changed pretty different because of all the water and wash out. ,2,2,0,0A 6,"The meteorologist statement described that as time went on the precipitation In  Charleston increased  little by little and thatês why it started flooding. But in 1963 the precipitation was  at its highest and Charleston wasnêt flooding, and hereês why because when thereês not enough permeable ground which is like soccer grass it soaks up the water like a sponge. But because  the population is growing  making the ground impermeable and not leaving enough permeable there was less space to soak up the water and as time went on they took up more and more space making the ground impermeable. From 1973 to 1983 the impermeable surface increased by 2 percent and from 1983 to 1993 it increased by 3 percent  the to 2003 3percent and to 2013 17 percent all in total 27 percent increase in impermeable land use. Causing less area for the rain and melted snow to go there for causing flooding in Charleston. If the city of Charleston were to grow even more in population the flooding would become worse the rain water has no were to go maybe if the city of Charleston were to install a draining  system  if a lake is over flooding from all the rain water a dam will work the streets over flooding some type of water tunnel  then that should fix the problem.",3,3,2,4A 7,"Yes, precipitation can and does play a key role in flooding the land of many cities, but in this case this is not the reason Charleston is being flooded.  The real reason why Charleston is flooded is because the up-take in of constructing more than one type of surface that does not let water through or does not use it in any roots or simply does not soak up the rain/precipitation. The local meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because they have not really had a problem with the increase in precipitation or steady heavy flow of it in the past. If it was accurate, that would mean that way back in the year 1973, they would have had problems with the large amount of precipitation; but to which they did not have any problems. Between the years of 1963 and 2013, that is a total of 50 years. That was fifty years in which we had time to build a large numbers of buildings, sidewalks, parks and much, much more. Sidewalks help us walk close or near a road or even just on a path to where we donêt have to walk in the mud or dirt, thus, they donêt soak up any kind of water or dirt. They can and will block water from soaking into the ground for the grass and or plants. Buildings also take  up large areas of the ground, which gives less space and area for water or in this case, precipitation to be soaked up to avoid flooding.  Both of these things take up a lot of space all around the world. Just think, In Charleston they are constantly building because of the increase in the population. So the higher the population, the more they will build to keep the population housed and schooled. With more and more people in their city, the more buildings and sidewalks they will require to keep the population happy. So the more and more ground blockage that Charleston has, the less and less precipitation soaks into the ground instead of flooding the area. With nowhere to go, the rain just sits until it can be dried up. That is what caused all of the flooding in Charleston. The flooding in Charleston was caused by all of the developed impermeable surfaces that people were making. It was not because of the increase in the precipitation. Increase in precipitation over the years may have carved out many more streams, ponds and lakes to contain all of the water.  So if that was the case, the rise in precipitation would not have caused all of this.",,,,A 8,"I would like to disagree with the Meteorologists argument that the flooding in Charleston has been caused by increase of rainfall. I believe that the flooding has been caused by the increase of developed-impermeable surfaces in Charleston. A developed-impermeable surface is a human made surface that doesnêt let water pass through such as sidewalks, roads, or buildings. This is my belief because since 1973 there has been a larger increase of developed-impermeable areas than permeable-areas and a decrease in natural areas. The flooding in Charleston has not been caused by the increase amount of rainfall because between the years of 1963 and 1973 there had been the same amount of rainfall but there were no floods and less developed-permeable areas, therefore letting the rain pass through more natural areas and it not flooding the developed-impermeable areas. ",3,4,4,4A 9,I believe that Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surface .I believe this fact because the area didnêt have a flooding problem until 2005 which is two years after expansion started. The reasons why we are getting this problem is because water cannot go through concrete sidewalks and thus has to go into any area it can such as roads and rivers. If the land had been flat water would have just stayed and not pooled anywhere? Also the rate of impermeable surfaces increased over the period so the rate is almost the same as natural surfaces.,,,, A 10,Flooding can be very bad for a community so figuring out and solving the problem is high priority with dealing with an area that floods a lot. The meteorologist says it floods more because the precipitation has gone up since 2005. The science class has data that shows that the percentage of developed-impermeable surfaces has raised a lot since 2005. I think that the reason it is flooding is because humans keep expanding the city with things that retain water too well. The meteorologistês outlook is that the precipitation is what is causing Charleston to flood more often. This is wrong because one there is no data to back up his statement and also there are plenty other factors that affect flooding than just precipitation. The meteorologist didnêt say why it was just precipitation and nothing else. There isnêt much evidence that makes the meteorologistês claim right and the science class wrong. But I will say there is evidence to show that there has been more precipitation but that isnêt the only thing that causes it to flood. The science class has plenty of data showing how much the city structure has changed over the years. In 1973 there were 75 percent natural areas twelve percent developed-permeable surfaces and thirteen percent developed-impermeable surfaces. In 2013 there were 45 percent natural areas nineteen percent developed-permeable surfaces and 36 percent developed-impermeable surfaces. With this data to look at you can see that when the city started expanding it also lost so much of its permeable surfaces. When a city expands it usually just booms and goes straight into building factories and more roads. The city has more roads and building so there is less room for the water to be saturated into the ground so there is more standing water. With the increased precipitation the water stays there for longer and with it staying there longer it evaporates into the clouds which in turn make it rain more. The more the city expands without allowing for flood protection plans or without allowing water to pass through it will flood. The city of Charleston has flooded a lot since 2005. Many people have their theoryês on why it is flooding more. There is a meteorologist on that thinks itês the increase of precipitation. A science class has data showing that the city has expanded and the surfaces have changed since 1973. With all of these factors you can see why Charleston floods a lot. With that new cities need to look at this as an example.,4,4,4,4A 11,"There is much debate about Charlestonês flooding problems. A local meteorologist has put his claim into the issue. He believes that the drastic increase of precipitation since 2005 in Charleston has caused the land to flood when it rains. But that can be easily proved wrong due to graphs of precipitation patterns in Charleston and Changes in land area coverage in Charleston.  In 1973 the annual average of precipitation raised rapidly. There are no reports of flooding during this time. Also in 1973, 75% of land area coverage was natural areas. This allowed water to flow away from the town or soak into the ground, keeping the land from flooding. In 2005, when local meteorologist believes the precipitation increased, the annual average of precipitation was drastically less than in 1973. Therefore, concluding that the meteorologistês claim is incorrect.  In current years, 2013, the percentage of natural areas has decreased to only 45% and developed- impermeable surfaces has risen to 36%. Developed- impermeable surfaces include sidewalks, buildings and roads. This states that almost 40% of the land in Charleston doesnêt have the ability to allow water to soak into the ground. This concludes that the reason Charleston, in recent years, has had a flooding problem due to increases in developed land area with impermeable surfaces.  ",,,,A 12 , The meteorologist stated that the reason for the flooding in Charleston was due to the increase of rain precipation in 2005 that stayed steadily because flooding had never been a problem before 2005. But the argument against the statement the meteorologist made was over time the developed impermeable surfaces increased causing the water not to be able to seep in to the ground. This was causing the water to stay on top of the ground causing the flooding. Between the years 2003-2013 the developed impermeable surfaces had a major jump from 21-36 unlike the years before where they would jump from 13-15 and 15-18 and so forth. My argument against the meteorologist would be that the cause of the flooding was not do to the rain precipitation increase in 2005 it was due to the increases in the impermeable surfaces that the water was not able to go through. The ratio in 2013 from the Impermeable and the permeable surfaces 36:16. Meaning there were more impermeable services than permeable surfaces. There were more buildings and parking lots added then there were soccer fields. ,3,4,3,4A 13,"The meteorologist quoted, The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. Looking at the graph it did show that the precipitation has increased steadily since about 2005, but back in 1973 there was the same amount of precipitation. If there was the same amount of rain and/or snowfall in both time periods, how come it wasnêt a problem until now? I will tell you; because the amount of developed-impermeable surfaces has gone up and the natural areas have gone done there arenêt as many permeable surfaces to soak up the precipitation to prevent flooding. Even though the number of permeable surfaces has gone up as well, the ratio of permeable and impermeable surfaces doesnêt balance to where it wonêt flood. Back in 1973 the percentage of Permeable areas was 87% in 2003 (2 years before 2005) the percentage of permeable surfaces was 79%. It was a sudden drop in the environment that wasnêt natural therefore; the water has to go somewhere. So the cause of the floods was that the amount of impermeable surfaces has gone down. If the natural surfaces and permeable areas went up as well or stayed the same the amount of precipitation would not have made floods. If they are looking for a solution to their problem, I would suggest increasing the amount of permeable and/or natural areas, since they cannot affect the amount of precipitation goes into their city. For example, they could build a football field for their schools (since they have 3) or they could build a garden. Any of these would not help the rain and/or snowfall but would decrease flooding.",4,4,4,4A 14,"I am here to inform the citizens of Charleston that your local meteorologist was incorrect. He claims that, and I quote, The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. It is true that precipitation has increased since 2005, and yes, this is when the flooding began. However, I can assure you that increased precipitation is not the cause of the flooding. According to your beloved meteorologist, Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. This seems like proof that the rise in precipitation is the cause, until you take into account the levels of precipitation in 1970, long before the flooding. The annual average precipitation for Charleston in 1970 was 58 inches, only two inches less than the precipitation in 2013. The real reason for the flooding is the decrease in permeable surfaces in Charleston since 1973. A permeable surface, if you did not know, is a surface that water can pass through. In Charleston, in the year 1973, 87% of land was permeable. Now, sadly, only 64% of land in Charleston allows water to soak into the ground. You see, this water trapped on the surface has nowhere to go, causing the flooding of your beloved city. The only reason that flooding did not begin before 2005 is that precipitation declined along with the percentage of permeable surfaces. However, precipitation levels are rising, and permeable surfaces are disappearing faster and faster. The water canêt go anywhere, so it remains trapped on the surface as water levels rise and floods appear. Careful observation of all the information disproves your meteorologistês claim as inaccurate. Feel free to present my counterclaim to your local meteorologist so that he may review it for further research into your flooding dilemma. Charleston, I wish you the best of luck, and I bid thee farewell.",,,,A 15,"The excessive flooding in Charleston is due to the increase of impermeable surfaces. The meteorologist claims that the flooding is due to the increased precipitation, which is not the case. The increase in precipitation would have just soaked into the soil like it was supposed to, if the ground permitted. The real reason for all of the flooding was caused by the impermeable surfaces that Charleston had. The data in the graphs show that the more impermeable surfaces we had in ratio with the natural and permeable surfaces, the more flooding we had because of it. The natural and permeable surfaces wouldêve permitted the precipitation into the soil, preventing flooding, and excessive erosion due to the flooding.  I also believe that the large amount of flooding was due to the lack of surfaces that wouldêve permitted precipitation. Although the graph does show a large amount of precipitation, that was not the cause for all of the flooding. You can see this in the second graph. The natural and permeable surfaces became significantly lower in number, as the impermeable surfaces grew. And because of the lack of knowledge on the surfaces, the flooding continued throughout as impermeable surfaces began to grow around Charleston. ",3,4,4,4A 16,The city of Charleston and there flooding problem is natural. It is honestly just a new since to the people because they are scared their houses will get damaged. They should come up with a plan b. They should build a dam or something for the water. Maybe if they built a dam it would decrease the number of floods in a year. ,0,1,0,0A 17,"The reason to why there has been an increase in flooding is not just because of natural areas.  Rain and snowfall run in a cycle, and this cycle has many stages it goes through to be able to let it rain or snow.  Yes natural areas could be a reason to why itês flooding maybe because the land isnêt soaking up all the rain fall fast enough but itês not the main reason why itês flooding in Charleston.  You have to include all the storms that have been going on around the world and hurricanes that have been happening the last few years. All the precipitation from the hurricanes are making its way around the world and causing it to rain or even have big storms in other towns across the coast and even other states across the state. A lot of the snow could be caused from all the storms and the temperature changes changing from ran to sleet to just and over load of snow build up from all the changes.  Charleston is not decreasing or increasing anymore then it has been, itês just called nature. Itês going to rain and snow itês just how the weather is. The same as when we have tornadoes and hail storms. Sometimes they happen more times in a year the last few years but it does still happen. Itês how the seasons go and how the world rotates. From 1983-2003 it was at a lower percentage rate but itês never going to be the same.",1,4,0,0A 18,"I would like to argue that the local meteorologistês claim is inaccurate. The first graph on the second page clearly indicates that there was an excessive amount of precipitation between 1963 and 1973. There was also a large amount a precipitation between 1983 and 1993. Yes, studies show that from 2005 and up, there indeed was an increase in precipitation, but the year of 2005 did not have half as much rainfall as in 1968, (the median between 1963-1973) indicating that there was surely flooding prior to 2005. I would also like to point out that on the second graph of page two, between 2005 to 2013; there was a significant drop in overall rainfall. There is no way 2005ês precipitation had anything to do with the city of Charlestonês flooding.",2,2,3,0 A 19," There was a city names Charleston that was made in da 1900ês. Over the past 10 years Charleston has made three schools, many homes and the population has grown since then. It also had expanded existing roads and built more sidewalks and parking lots. While all of that was going on the citizens of Charleston notice that the city floods each time it rained heavily. The flooding has never been a problem for Charleston until 2005. Ever since 2005 the floods have increase in freguency. As the flooding was goin on a local middle school science class was investigating the problem. So the students started collecting data about the cities precipitation over the last 50 years and the amount of land used for different purposes. So measuring of precipitation indicates how much rain and snow the city received. So the first thing they did was split up the land three categories 1. Was Developed _ impermeable surface, the 2. Thing was Developed _permeable surface, last but not least the 3. Thing was Natural Areas. So after they gathered up all their information they made a graph that showed all the data that they collected. ",0,2,0,0A 20,"Recently there has been a problem with flooding in Charleston. Many meteorologists say that this is strictly because of increased precipitation in the area. After looking at the data it can be concluded that this is not true.  Even though the meteorologists are right about increased precipitation in the area this is not the main contributing factor to the flooding. I think that the reason flooding has become a problem is because of newly developed, impermeable, surfaces.  I know this because the precipitation amounts in 2013 are very similar to those in the early 1970s. The only big difference about these two time periods is the amount of land that has been developed, creating an impermeable surface.  I know this because looking at the change in land area in Charleston you can see a steady increase in developed, impermeable land and a steady decrease in permeable, natural land. This I believe is the contributing factor to the flooding considering the similar amounts of rainfall in the early 1970s which had no issue of flooding, this further supports my claim that the flooding issue is caused by the amount of impermeable land that started to steadily increase at a rapid rate in 2005. Based on this I believe that the flooding is caused the increasing amount of impermeable land and not the increased amount of precipitation in the Charleston area.",,,,A 21,"The flooding of Charleston is not because of the increased precipitation numbers of the years. That is wrong because Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Like when water reaches concrete, the concrete is going to absorb the water and the concrete is going to crack and break down which is going to make the land surfaces go down. Dirt for example will absorb water but not affect it like it does concrete because dirt needs water. That is why they are due to the land areas and impermeable surfaces. The meteorologistês statement is incorrect because flooding isnêt caused by participation it is caused by the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Like buildings, if water gets in to the concrete basement of a building then the concrete is going to absorb that water and start to break down and slope farther into the land which will make it more capable for floods to happen because the land is starting to be at a down slope. When there is too much water for dirt to absorb it will also make the land sink and more capable for floods to happen because the land will be sloped. This happens most in natural areas where there are no buildings to block off the water. In natural areas where there are no buildings and just trees and stuff then those are the areas where the dirt wonêt be able to absorb all of the water and the land will flood because there is no other place for that water to go because the dirt sucked up all that it could. There is starting to be more floods in developed Impermeable surfaces each year.  You can tell because the percentages are going up each year. This means that they need to slow down or maybe even eliminate some impermeable surfaces because that is where all of the floods are beginning to be at. If they slow down the production of impermeable surfaces then they can limit the amount of floods that they have. This is why the meteorologist was wrong by his statement.  ",3,4,3,3A 22,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land with impermeable surfaces. The local meteorologistês claims are inaccurate because the town of Charleston didnêt have any flood problems until about 2005. But the meteorologist said that it was an increase in precipitation in 2003 that made it eventually start flooding in 2005, but in 1963 the precipitation levels were about the same as they were in 2010. That right there is ruling out that it is the increase in weather leaving it to be some other change that happened between 2003- 2013. In the year 1973 the natural areas were at 75%, by 2003 they were only at 62%. Over the years the natural resources percentage has continued to go down as man made impermeable and permeable percentages have gone up. In just 10 years (2003-2013) the natural resources percentage went down by 17% and the developed- impermeable surfaces went up by 15%. Steadily the natural resources percentage went down up until about 2003-4 when it started going down by the most it ever has. To conclude why the meteorologist is incorrect because he thought the flooding was caused by the precipitation. In 1973 there was also a lot of rain, but they had also had the natural resources to keep up with the heavy precipitation. And as the natural resources went down and the precipitation grew heavier the man made impermeable surfaces couldnêt keep up, thus making the flooding in Charleston be the worst itês ever been.",4,2,4,3A 23,"Charlestonês flooding has been a problem since 2005. The meteorologistês argument for the cause of the flooding, is that since 2005 there has been an increase of precipitation. He claims that this is the only reason for the start of the flooding. While an increase of precipitation probably did have some effect on the flooding, it is not the only reason. The amount of land coverage with developed-impermeable surfaces also had an effect on the flooding. The meteorologist claims the annual average precipitation had gone up and that was the only reason for the start of the flooding. The average amount of rain and snowfall canêt be the only reason Charleston started to flood more recently. Back in 1973, there was almost the same amount of rain and snowfall, but it didnêt flood then. There is more than just one reason that Charleston had started to flood since 2005. While precipitation probably had some effect on the flooding, there had to be another reason. Ever since 2005, since the population of Charleston started to grow, the city has been growing and expanding on to make more room. On graph two, it shows that the area of developed-impermeable surfaces has increased fifteen percent, and natural area has decreased seventeen percent. Because of that shift, there isnêt as much room for the rain to go, which is what had led to the increase in flooding over the last 10 years. Between the increase of precipitation and the decrease of natural area coverage, Charleston had an increase of flooding since 2005.",3,4,4,4A 24,"The meteorologist would be incorrect about the flooding in Charleston. He says the precipitation has been increasing since 2005 but on our graphs we have been increasing then decreasing since 1963 then back up in 1993. There has been a lot of precipitation from 1963 to 2013. So flooding was a problem before 2005 because of all the precipitation. Charleston has a flooding problem, during the years of 1963-1973 and the year of 2013 flooding was at an all-time high. During these few years flooding was at an all-time low 1983 and 2003. So the students are right. ",2,2,3,0A 25,"Perhaps, the meteorologist is right. The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation, and the annual precipitation datashow that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since 2005. When I go back to the annual average precipitation I see that the patters have been steady since 1975. But, the rain and snowfall started to get bad around 2003. But, when Charleston got all that rain, it must have been because they needed it. Even though they may have gotten to much. The reason why it flooded badly like it did was for the fact that the concrete didnêt suck up the water that good, and the dams, or lakes couldnêt hold all that water.  Also, a problem could be is that the city has grown over the years, and there has probably been a lot more farms, and houses being built. The expanding of roads, parking lots. ",2,3,0,0A 26,I believe that the meteorologist is not correct when he talks about why the city has had flooding due to the more rain and snowfall the city has received since the year 2005. He tells us that the annual snowfall and rainfall have increases since 2005 which is now causing flooding. But there was a lot of rain and snowfall in the years of 1963 to 1976 then it took a break for a while and then there started to be more rainfall which caused more and more flooding. When water falls it runs off into places and soaks into the ground but when there is too much rain the water erodes things and goes crazy and floods. But the claim that the meteorologist made about their only being flooding since 2005 is false because there was flooding before that in the years prior. Although he is correct about there being flooding because there is more rain than normal he still isnêt correct about it being after 2005. The changes in the Permeable surfaces and the Impermeable are higher in the years following 2005 but there is still evidence before 2005. In conclusion he is wrong.,3,3,4,0A 27,"Charlestonês flooding problems are definitely due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces.  The local meteorologistês claim is inaccurate for many reasons. They are 4 different pieces of information that help understand that claim. There is an article, and 2 graphs.  One graphs show the precipitation problems and the 2nd one shows the changes in land area coverage in Charleston. The 4th is a statement from a meteorologist.  The article Charlestonês Flooding Problem gives lots of information supporting the claim. Charleston has expanded roads and built more sidewalks and parking lots. They never had a problem with flooding until 2005. Not too much before 2005 they most likely made those expanding changes.  Every single time it rains heavily, it floods. Every time it rains heavily, not only does it flood, the floods seem to get worse throughout time.  Citizens of Charleston are concerned because the floods cause damage and they are very dangerous. Graph 1 shows the precipitation patterns in Charleston. The Average precipitation for 1963 was about 52 inches. In 1993 it was about 45 inches. Then in 2013 it was about 60 inches.  The precipitation patterns donêt seem to have anything to do with the flooding situations. Throughout the years the precipitation patterns have went up and down. They did not decrease and they did not increase. They just simply went all over the place. Graph 2 shows the changes in land area coverage in Charleston. It shows natural areas, and developed-permeable surfaces, and developed-impermeable surfaces.  In 1973 the percentage of different surfaces for natural areas, was 75%. Developed-permeable surfaces were 12% and developed-impermeable surfaces were 13%. 2013 shows natural areas was 45%, developed-permeable surfaces is 19%, and developed-impermeable surfaces was 36%. Throughout time the natural surfaces percentage went down quite a bit. The developed-permeable surfaces percentage went up a smidge at a time. Developed-impermeable went up and down. The meteorologist said The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data shows that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. All of the information above shows why that is a spurious statement.",,,,A 28,Charlestonês flooding problems are not due to increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Because on the data it says that there is least developed impermeable surfaces. Natural areas have the most land out of the three. The meteorologistês claim was inaccurate because if the cause of the flooding was because of all of the impermeable surfaces then that would be covering up Charleston the most.,,,,A 29,The town of Charleston is flooding because of the amount of precipitation but the meteorologist say that the rain was causing the flooding because it started raining more in 2005 when the flooding started because of all the precipitation. The more  impermeable surfaces the less flooding because they would be open area for the rain to run instead of building up in between buildings and if they had more creeks for water to flow out of the town it wouldnêt flood as much or as bad as it has been. If they didnêt build buildings they would have more open areas.  ,2,4,0,0 A 30,"The claim of the meteorologist is that the cause of the floods in Charleston is an increase in precipitation since 2005. The meteorologists claim is false. The precipitation is not the factor that that is making the rise in flood. The graph that shows the amount of precipitation in the time between 1964 and 1983 is about the same as the amount of precipitation that has happened in the time period of 1993 to 2013. Also there is no evidence of any floods in the period of 1963 to 1983. So the meteorologistês claim is false, also the cause of the floods is the amount of developed-impermeable surfaces. The amount of impermeable surfaces has increased quite a bit in the time period from 1973 to 2013, which means when it rain there is no way for the water to go; which then leads to a huge flood all through Charleston. ",3,4,4,4A 31,"In the growing town of Charleston they are getting more and more rain and that is causing floods to surface, the question is why. As the class tries to find out why, they ask a meteorologist for help and show him there data. He says that the floods are due to the increased precipitation, and that in turn makes the rain and snow fall increase. He also points out that the flooding has not been a problem until the rain and snow fall went up. This is inaccurate. The reason for more rain and snow is not entirely due to the rising precipitation but the city itself.  As the city grows more and more land is covered by materials that donêt allow water to pass through them. Also lands that are natural of can let water pass through them are shrinking. What this is doing is that the water that falls on pavement cant seep into the ground like it can do in a forest of filed. This lets the water just evaporate back in to the sky almost soon after falling. This is why they rain and snow fall has increased, there is nowhere for the water to go.  ",,,,A 32,"The Charlestonês flooding problem is not due to just the increase in precipitation, even though that does have a small play into it. The meteorologistsê claim is inaccurate because based on the data given to us from the research done by the class shows that the precipitation increased around the start of 2003-2004. Therefore after a whole year (or two) after the precipitation increase they then began to have flooding problems. If they had more permeable things it would allow the precipitation to flow and not get held up and then cause the flooding problems they have currently in Charleston. My claim for the Charlestonês flooding problem is that the cause of the flooding issue is coming from having a higher majority of Impermeable buildings. This is because, since they more than likely build the new buildings on the old natural area which probably had a lot of rainfall to begin with, they will now have a higher precipitation rate and more flooding than they would like to have. The Impermeable surface doesnêt allow water to pass through it so when it rains the water is help within whatever is containing it, whether it is a bucket or the impermeable buildings they now have. Therefore saying that I believe if they made a few more permeable stuff their floods wouldnêt be so brutal.",4,4,3,4A 33,"Recently, there has been a flooding problem in Charleston. One of the middle school classes decided to find out why, and claimed that it was due to precipitation. A local meteorologist says itês because of the more and more loss of natural land being replaced with recent developed impermeable surfaces. Charleston flooding problem are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The local meteorologists claim is also inaccurate. The kidsê data claims that precipitation is the reason of the recent flooding. The meteorologists claim is incorrect because he claims that as humans take more and more of natural areas, the more the flooding that will happen. The local middle school class claims that the flooding is due to heavy precipitation. They are correct. The inch of precipitation has drastically been higher since 2005 to now. This would clearly explain why the recent flooding. More precipitation usually means flooding until the earth can naturally collect drainage. We try our best to build drainage ditches as often and as many places as we can but flooding will always still happen.",,,,A 34,"In the city of Charleston the annual precipitation data shows that rain and snowfall in the area have increased since 2005, but so has the population of people in Charleston. Charleston was founded in the early 1900s and has grown a lot over the past 10 years. The citizens of Charleston are worried because all of the floods that have been happening because flooding can cause property damage. Some of the impermeable surfaces donêt soak up any water; however some of the other surfaces donêt   soak up enough water to prevent the flooding. Therefore the flooding problem is cause by the increase in impermeable surfaces. A meteorologist looked at the data and said The cause of Charlestonês flooding is the increased precipitation, but he is inaccurate. Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. His claim is wrong because there was an increase in 2005, but the natural areas were developed impermeable. So therefore the meteorologist  was  wrong.",,,,A 35,"Charleston was founded in the early 1900ês. However, the city of Charleston has increased in population and size since then. Charleston also has encountered flooding since about 2005. It has grown in size since then. Impermeable surfaces, such as schools and homes, have developed since it was founded. The Impermeable surfaces added by the people donêt soak up the water from the rainfall Charleston receives. There are some permeable services but they donêt soak up enough water to reduce the flooding. Therefore, Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The meteorologist invited by the class says that the flooding problem is the increase in precipitation. There was an increase in rainfall in 2005 but however, the area of natural areas and permeable surfaces were decreased. After the rain fell from the sky it didnêt have anywhere to go, so it would flood. Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increase undeveloped land areas with impermeable surfaces. In the data on the graph collected by the class shows that in between 2003 and 2013 fifteen impermeable surfaces were developed, seventeen natural areas were lost and only 2 permeable surfaces were added. This shows that the increase in impermeable surfaces is the cause for the flooding in Charleston. ",,,,A 36,"The claim that the meteorologist gave to the students about the precipitation rate is right it did rise in 2005 but, that doesnêt mean that the city didnêt have floods before that with the amount of precipitation they were getting. But that is not exactly why the floods are happening more, itês because the land doesnêt have as much natural areas, so with the land changing it is disrupting the natural flow of the run off. So when it rains or snows the water will go into the streets in large amounts therefore causing floods to happen more frequently.  ",3,4,3,0A 37,"The meteorologists claim is inaccurate because developed permeable surfaces could still have rain water still in the surface. Impermeable surfaces like buildings, sidewalk, and roads donêt allow the rain water to go through. Permeable surfaces allow rain water to go through. While the rain water goes through the permeable surface, over time all the rain water could just be building up and as the more rain you get, the more rain water builds up in the permeable surfaces. So when the permeable surfaces are filled with rain water and more rain comes, the rain water that is built up could just overflow and cause it to flood. As it started to flood in 2005, permeable surfaces were barely increasing while impermeable surfaces were abundantly increasing. More impermeable surfaces were being developed which would allow permeable surfaces to keep the rain water. ",2,4,2,0A 38,"The local meteorologist said the flood problem is do to the increase in rainand snowfall in 2005 which is when the flooding happened. This is incorrect though. In this essay I will explain why he is wrong and the real cause of the flooding. The real reason for the flooding is due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. I know this because, in 1963 they had higher amounts of rain in 2005. So it canêt be because they had more rain because in 1963 it didnêt flood.  If it wasnêt the rain you have to look at what changed and the thing that changed was the amount of permeable surfaces. In 1963 there was 87% permeable surfaces and only 13% impermeable surfaces but in 2003 there was only 79% permeable surfaces and 21% impermeable surfaces and we know the impermeable number of things were increasing still between the two years. The cause of the flood was because of the increase in the number of impermeable things and we know this because in 1963 they had more rain and snow  than in 2005 and so increase in rain and snow canêt be the problem because it didnêt flood in1963. But the number in impermeable things went up so the water lad less places to go when it rained.  Also the number impermeable buildings is the only thing that changes that could cause flooding.",3,4,3,4A 39,"The meteorologistês claim about why Charleston is flooding. He isnêt wrong, however about the rise of annual rainfall. This is inaccurate because the amount of impermeable surfaces has been rising. This is causing the amount of natural permeable areas to decrease. In the 1970s, Charleston had the same amount of annual rainfall and flooding wasnêt a problem then. This is because the amount of natural areas has drastically decreased since then. That means there is a lower amount of area in Charleston that has the ability to soak up water to prevent flooding. Flooding didnêt become an issue until 2005, but by that time the amount of natural areas, which are permeable, had greatly decreased. The number of developed-permeable surfaces has only risen slowly and by miniscule numbers. The rate of that increase isnêt enough to replace the amount of natural areas that have become developed. In contrast to that, the amount of developed-impermeable surfaces has had an increase over the years and is now on an uphill slope. All of those factors can be factored into the fact that Charleston has been having more floods in the past decade than the century of the townês founding.",4,3,4,4A 40,"In Charleston there was a meteorologist that said that the cause of the local floods in Charleston Is due to the amount of precipitation. But Iêm telling you as of right now this claim are inaccurate.  The meteorologist has the right concepts but he didnêt use all the resources given to come to a conclusion. The claim he states conflicts with the pattern of rain in the 1973ês where they had the high precipitation of 2005 and up. Therefore his claim is inaccurate. The reason Charleston is having lots of local floods is due the amount of impermeable surfaces in Charleston. Impermeable surfaces do not allow water to pass through them.  How you may ask is how that affects whether we have floods or not. Well if water doesnêt have anywhere to go you got a flood. My proof behind why this theory is more so accurate than the meteorologistês is the proof I have to back it up. In 1973 the amount of precipitation was around 57-59 inches in rain. 2013 the precipitation was roughly around 58-60 inches of rain. So how did the meteorologist get that the amount of precipitation is the cause of floodingês in Charleston? Well in 1983 to 2003 they had a very low amount of precipitation. (Graph 2). Now the real reason why there have been floods in Charleston more than the past is because in 1973 the ground was 75% natural areas, 12% developed permeable surfaces, and 13% developed impermeable surfaces. Keep in mind in 1973 the rain was almost just like the rain in 2013. In 2013 the ground was 45% natural grounds, 19% developed permeable surfaces, and 36% developed impermeable surfaces. So the real issue of the flood is the surface not allowing the water to drain off! That is like 1/3 of Charleston! (Graph 2) The meteorologist was wrong when he said it was due to the amount of precipitation, it is actually due to the amount of surface where water cannot drain off or at. If they could fix this problem by making them drainable surfaces then maybe we could fix the flood issue!",4,4,3,4A 41,"The meteorologist is inaccurate because he said that the increase in the precipitation started in 2005, but the precipitation levels were high in the 1963 and the flooding did not become a problem till 2005. The flooding started happening because there was more and more developed- Impermeable Surfaces starting in 2005. Charleston had more space being taken up was causing the water to have nowhere to go, so flooding was happening. If there were more areas with grass, would help because the ground would soak up the water, or having a dam to help the water going because if it has nowhere to go it will, just start flooding. The meteorologist is incorrect because the precipitation levels were high in the 90ês were high and the flooding was so bad, it is caused because there is more Impermiable  Surfaces being used than before.  It would help if the Charleston would use less Impermiables Surfaces, or try to find another way to get the water flowing out of the town. ",3,3,3,4A 42,"Charlestonês claim that states Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces In graph one the patterns are from 1963-2013. In 1963 the water was about 51, but decreased a lot between 1963 and 1983. So the claim is that the rain increased flooding problem precipitation steadily about 2005, so during the year 1963 the rain levels were high. What made the rain levels decrease? The lack of land and the impermeable surfaces was the reason the water is decreasing over the years. The land is changing. Why the local meteorologist claimed that it was inaccurate is because the chart patter doesnêt show the lack of the land and the impermeable surfaces being gone so itês causing the water to die down.  The meteorologist argument is that although the rain has increased in flooding it has caused erosion therefore the rain did decrease in 1936. The natural changes in land area coverage is showing the developed permeable and the impermeable surfaces on average they are close together. It states the cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increase precipitation the annual precipitation data shows that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. The data in the charts for precipitation patterns in Charleston show that in had a balance of increasing to the causing of the floods, example 1963 was 51, to 2013 were 60. Therefore the rain has increased. My claim is that the flooding did increase flooding Charleston because of the impermeable and permeable surfaces.  Leading to Charleston claim, yes the flooding increased through time. ",,,,A 43,I agree that the cause of the flooding is the due to the amount in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The cause of the flooding is because of the Natural Areas getting lower and lower every 10 years. The lower and lower the Natural Areas the more chance for a flood. For every 10 years that the Natural areas go down the Permeable and Impermeable surfaces get higher and higher. Over the years that Charlestown has been without floods the changes in natural area have been getting smaller and smaller causing a higher chance of floods to occur therefore that is raising the chance of floods in the little town of Charlestown. So if they raising the Natural areas in Charlestown then the permeable and impermeable surfaces Should lower a lil bit an make the chances of a flood go down. ,2,2,0,3A 44,"The meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because the land coverage of Natural Areas was decreasing a lot in 2005 and in the Developed-Permeable Surfaces, and the Impermeable Surfaces really went up in 2005. And the horrible building of the sidewalks and roads was another reason the town was flooded so bad. ",,,,A 45,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces because the more land that is used for things such as buildings and sidewalks will cause there to be less area for water to be soaked up which will lead to flooding. Also the more land that the people in Charleston take up or use will cause even more flooding because there wonêt be enough area for the water to be soaked up, it will just flood over the sidewalks and flood in buildings. The meteorologistês argument and claim is inaccurate because in the precipitation graph it shows that the amount of precipitation has actually went down from being sixty inches of rain to about thirty-six inches of rain from the years 1963-2005. Also another reason why the meteorologistês claim and argument is wrong is that there has been more land that has been used for certain purposes which has caused there to be less developed-impermeable surfaces. The people started to use developed-permeable surfaces instead which does not allow water to be soaked up. Charleston has been flooding more because of the developed-impermeable surfaces being used and the area space they are using. For example, they use developed-permeable surfaces which humans have created with materials that do not allow water to go through.  An example of developed-permeable surfaces is sidewalks, buildings, and roads. Which all of the things take up most of the space because if not it wouldnêt be a place to live in. Also the flooding occurs more because the developed-permeable areas continue to increase which is causing them to have more flooding. ",3,4,4,4A 46,"The increased precipitation of the area of Charleston is not the cause of the flooding. The actual cause of the flooding is due to the new developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Since the new developed land is impermeable when the rain and snow begin to fall the land doesnêt begin to erode away from the precipitation occurring. So the land stays the same way or almost the same forever instead of eroding away like developed permeable surfaces. The amount of natural areas has been decreasing since 1973, but the developed-permeable surfaces and the Developed-impermeable surfaces have been increasing since 1973. So the more rain that they get the more the natural areas with decrease. The meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because not all of the land areas around Charleston are decreasing. The more rain they get doesnêt affect the permeable surfaces so it falls down into the natural areas of the land and begins to erode them away little by little each year. So once the water is on the permeable surfaces itês hard for it to get off because they cannot soak into the surface of the land like they could on natural areas. If the land of Charleston had more natural areas around their more permeable areas of land the flooding wouldnêt be so bad because the precipitation has a place to go instead of sitting and spreading on the permeable places.",3,4,4,4A 47,"The meteorologistês argument is how the local middle school science class is investigating the problem of Charlestonês Flooding Problem. As the students collected data over the last 50 years of the cityês precipitation they noticed land use was divided into three categories. Such as a Developed- permeable surfaces, Natural areas, and Developed- impermeable surfaces. Developed-impermeable surfaces are areas that humans have created with materials that do not allow water to go through like sidewalks, buildings, and roads. Developed- permeable surfaces are areas that humans have created with materials allowing to go through soccer fields covered with grass. Natural areas are spaces that have not been developed by humans like forest areas. Graph 1, the precipitation patterns in Charleston shows from   (1963-2013) the annual average precipitation throughout the years. Graph 2 shows changes in land Area Coverage in Charleston. The percentage of different surfaces.  Flooding had never been a problem for Charleston until about 2005, but the floods have increased ever since.  Although citizens are concerned because flooding can be dangerous and cause many damages such as property damage which will cause many issues throughout the city. Many people could lose their homes, jobs and schools also.  Charlestonês flood issues have become huge. Itês so dangerous to live there when so many floods have occurred. Due to the increasing in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces the meteorologists claim is inaccurate because itês so not safe. ",,,,A 48,"The meteorologist claims that the increase in precipitation is the cause of the flooding. The flooding is not just due to precipitation increase, so there for the meteorologists claim is inaccurate. The research and data the class has gathered proves that the meteorologist is incorrect. The data shows the rain increased around the year of 2003-2004. The meteorologist claims it increased in 2005. It took over a year or two for the flooding to actually begin. What I believe is an accurate claim of the cause of the flooding is the impermeable surfaces that are being created. An impermeable surface is a surface that does not drain or soak up water. So when the rain is happening and itês puddling up around these impermeable surfaces, the water is sitting and not soaking up which allows it to get deeper and starts to flood.  With all impermeable surfaces or buildings around natural land is allowing the water to just increase and as it rains more, the flooding then gets worse. Sine Charleston is in a more natural area, than the rainfall will be heavy anyways.  I believe if Charleston made more permeable surfaces and buildings then the floods or the increase in rainfall would not do as much damage as the floods are now. These permeable surfaces would help soak up the rainfall which could help drop the percentage of floods. So my claim is that the flooding is caused by impermeable surfaces not being able to soak up the water and this allows the water to increase in mass. Creating more permeable buildings or surfaces would stop the flooding from occurring as much. ",4,4,3,3A 49,In 1973 the amount of land that was untouched by man was 75% only a combined 25% percent was man 12% of the 25% was developed permeable surfaces the other 13% of the 25% percent was developed impermeable surfaces. It was not precipitation in 2005 that caused the floods it was the amount of land man was using because only 62% of untouched land was left in 2003 ten years later only 45% remained now that we have discussed that lets discuss the amount of precipitation in 2003 it was 33% precipitation in 2003 and ten years later it is 60% precipitation now in time yes that would cause a flood but in this case we can only blame man for their stupid ways you can sit here and say that precipitation caused this in ten years but I hate to tell you if they keep removing the remaining natural land it will definitely cause more floods. ,,,,A 50,"The meteorologistês accusations are inaccurate. They are inaccurate because in about 1964 the precipitation was about the same as it was in 2005. Flooding may have been a problem in 1964-1970; but there is not any record of it. Also there is more water use in the natural areas than there is in the impermeable areas in every decade. he also needs to think about all the places the water in not going through because in the nautral parts there is not water running though the sidewalks, buildings, and roads. In my opinion I think Charlestonês flooding problem is due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. This is my opinion because through the years they have built things over the areas and expected them to adapt to the precipitation that happens and not all places can. Also in the natural areas were not man-made they were just there by nature. The impermeable area was man-made with the buildings and such and thatês why all the water gets built up and makes it flood. The natural has buildings; yes but they were built around so the water can flow naturally throughout the town.  ",3,3,3,4A 51,"The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem, is the change in how over the years, impermeable surfaces have increased. Since the rate of developed impermeable surfaces has increased, when it rained, the water didnêt have anywhere to go, it didnêt get soaked up, and causing floods to occur. In 2005, when the floods started occurring, is when the amount of impermeable started developing more than the permeable surfaces were developing. This showing, that the meteorologistsê claim was inaccurate. Proving the meteorologistsê claim was not accurate, in 2005, precipitation was at one of the lowest points. If flooding were to start occurring because of the precipitation, it wouldêve in 1963, when the precipitation levels were higher.  Therefore, increased impermeable surface rates have led to local flooding.",,,,A 52,"No one will never know how terrifying and all of the tragedyês happen due to The Charlestonês Flooding Problem making it to were all of this new land that they get will be hardly flat and maybe all rugged. Due to this flooding Charleston has even built 3 new schools because of this flood and also many more houses were built in Charleston due to the flooding. In Charleston they have made many more sidewalks and roads and even added on to many other roads, mainly in Charleston when it rains really heavy there will be a flood in Charleston. Since 2005 floods have frequently increased over the years which is not very good, but even though you might think that citizens can go and hide in their house for shelter but youêre wrong, citizens are concerned because flooding can be very dangerous especially with its environment like trees because they could fall and you could get hurt while in the process of it falling down. Recently scientists have collected data on Precipitation patterns in Charleston 1963-2013, in the year of 1963-1973 were a little bit the same but not the same but pretty close it was around 50 inches of rain. Then 1983-1993 were about 2 centimeters apart which was up to around 30-35 inches yearly thatês a lot of rain for Charleston. Then for 2003 the inches of rain went off and on every once and a while because one point itês at 30 then the next time around 32 or even 33 but itês a lot of rain. Then in 2013 is when they got the most of their rain which was 60 inches of rain but although it still donêt compare to how much rain South America gets per day. Recently scientist have focus on another thing on Charleston and that is Changes in land area coverage in Charleston  and also the percent of different surfaces they have Natural Areas, Developed- Permeable Surfaces and Developed- Impermeable Surfaces . For Natural areas in 1973 it was 75%, in 1983 it was 72%, in 1993 it was 67%, in 2003 it was 62%, in 2013 it was 45% so all together it was all going down. For Permeable Surfaces in 1973 it was 12%, in 1983 it was 13%, in 1993 it was 15%, in 2003 it was 17%, and then in 2013 it was 19% so when it started it started really low then it went really high. Then for Impermiable Surfaces in 1973 it was 13%, then in 1983 it was 15%, then in 1993 it was 18%, then in 2003 it was 17%, then in 2013 it was 36% so it started low then went really high. Scientist know a lot about the world but I really do hope I can learn more about the world and understand how everything works in the newer world like with much higher technology but this essay was based on the Charleston Flooding Problem which was more of an agricultural problem for them.",,,,A 53,"The meteorologist is saying that there were no floods, but they were coming their way by the end of 2004 going on 2005 they had floods everywhere.

I bet a lot of people died. They say humans have created with materials that allow water to go through like a soccer fields covered with grass.  The floods increase a lot in Charleston because form looking at this grid is that the flood didnêt start increasing till 2003 -2013 so like I said people should leave from there and never go back as well as making things a little bit tough so the city wonêt flood as well as the everything else wonêt flood either.",0,1,1,0A 54,The meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because his graphs are not right that he made. The cause of the flooding problem is only the population. The data shows that rain and snowfall have increased. The meteorologistês data does not say that. Increased precipitation has led to local flooding. Charlestonês flooding problems are also due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Charleston has grown a lot over the last ten years. Flooding has increased a lot over the last ten years since 2005. Citizens are concerned because flooding can be dangerous and cause property damage. ,2,1,3,2A 55,The city of Charleston will receive more rain and snow this year in the areas of Developed-Permeable surfaces and Developed-Impermiable surfaces do to the graph in 1973 those two areas received 12 and 13% of the rain. In 1983 the two areas got 13 and 15% rain for 2003 the two still progressively received more rain than normal with a 17 and a 21. When it was 2013 the rain amount jumped was normal for the Developed-Permeable Surfaces but in the area of Developed-Impermiable Surfaces it jumped up 15%. From the looks of the graph soon if things donêt get solved or changed the city of Charleston will flood costing thousands or even millions of dollars in damage. The best years for Charleston was 1983 and in-between 1993-about 1996. What they were doing in those years they need to do again because it caused the flooding to be controlled and it will save them lots of money to put into the city to improve.,2,3,2,1A 56,It sounds like it floods more in the developed-impermeable surfaces because they built things that donêt let the water go through. But where it doesnêt flood as much is the developed-permeable surfaces were the water goes through the material that they built the stuff with. I think that before the population and they started to build more things it wasnêt flooding as much. The main reason for building more things was because there population was growing.  When everyone started to notice the flooding was in 2005. Thatês most likely the reason for the floods.,0,4,0,1A 57,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Many locations in Charleston donêt have reliable water systems. Drains can only hold a certain amount of water at a time as it flows throughout the drain pipes. Once the drain fills up it starts slowly leaking water making roads and land flood. The people of Charleston think this may be caused by increase of precipitation in the past ten years, every year it rains more and more making it impossible to eliminate all the water and flooding. The local meteorologist thinks itês also due to increased precipitation, but the majority of the flooding isnêt due to the increase of rain and snowfall. The reason why its flooding is most likely because a local lake/pond started to over flow because of the rain, and once those bodies of water began to flood; water slowly started making its way throughout Charleston. After the flood began, more and more rain began to fall, making the flood bigger. Possibilityês to why the flooding began is some debris could have clogged a drainage pipe or part of a dam, making it hard for water to access it. The flooding in Charleston is due to the increases in developed land areas. And probable drain clogging.",,,,A 58,The middle school investigated the problem. They divided into three categories. The class had local meteorologist to examine their data. The meteorologist didnêt agree with the class. He or she said the cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. What the meteorologist said wasnêt true because it was still kind of low in 2005 it didnêt start getting bigger until 2013. And there have been plenty of times where was low then got more rain then got low again. The developed impermeable surface was only at 21 and the developed permeable surface was at 17. I think the kids were right and they did well with their data and the meteorologist didnêt know what they were talking about. The kids did everything good in trying to figure out the the increased in rain. They put the land in three categories that helped them the most I think.  My conclusion is that the meteorologist didnêt know what he was talking about. And he had no reason to argue with the kids because they had all the facts so what was there to argue about. I donêt really have anything else to say. ,2,1,3,0A 59,"The city of Charleston started  out small but over the years has grown and has many citizens, but recently the citizens has had an issue with  flooding that started in 2005. After a class at the local middle school investigated and collected data the local meteorologist came to a conclusion. He claimed that the flooding over the past years is due to increased precipitation. Looking at the data I believe that that is not true. The flooding is caused by increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The meteorologists claim about why the Charleston area is flooding is incorrect because there are many more factors other than the precipitation that could have caused the flooding. The annual average precipitation was almost as high, or higher, in 1963-1973, than it was now or in 2005. Also the developed impermeable surfaces percentage has increased the natural areas percentage has decreased, and the developed permeable surfaces have increased, all since 2005. The land has a huge impact on where the water goes and how it settles. The precipitation could just be a small factor as to why the town is flooding. I believe that the flooding is due to increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Developed impermeable surfaces are areas that human have created such as; sidewalks, roads, buildings, etc. These areas do not allow water to go through due to the material used to make these. This would cause the water to all go one direction and cause a flood when it rains, or snows.  If there were an increase in natural areas and a modification to developed land areas with impermeable surfaces the amount of flooding would decrease. I think the meteorologist has little evidence to support his claim. I believe the flooding is due to the developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. I can tell by looking at the data middle school science class has collected and by my own knowledge of water systems. ",4,4,4,4A 60,"In Charleston there is a bad flooding problem, like they get 30 to 60 inches of rain. Therefore, it made a lot of changes to the land now. Why is it changing so fast? Because it floods so much and sticks around and can damage stuff easily and can ruin a lot of peopleês homes or jobs to support their family.  But in the years the rain stopped flooding so bad. Charlestonês town says that there rain was increasing because of all the flooding in 2005. Local meteorologists claim for that to be inaccurate.  The meteorologists are right because in 1973 75% of the land area was natural areas. By 1993, it percentages and precipitation started lowering down to the high 60ês and 30ês for precipitation. In 2003, only 62% was natural areas and the Permeable and the impermeable areas starting getting bigger. By 2005, there was at least a 60% to 59% for natural areas. By 2013 the developed impermeable was almost got as much rain as the natural areas got. That means that the natural areas were decreasing by a lot every year, and did a lot of damage to Charlestonês town. So therefore that the meteorologists were righty about it being inaccurate, so the percentage was ended up going down not up. ",,,,A 61,"Due to the meteorologistês across the area having said that these problems are in accurate. What the local Middle school is studying this right now and working to solve this. Water systems sometimes where they tend to get to full that they flood the area around it. The Meteorologist is wrong on this case do not let this person say that the water problem is caused by rain are wrong. If we were going to stop the flooding we would need to devise a plan to stop it like sandbags, Barriers.  The percentages of Rain from 1963 to 2013 Has changed by the data being high at 1973 to sloping down to rising. Plus that if we were going to take care of the land and building a wall or Barricades to stop the chances of being flooded again . The land has changed a lot between 1973 _ 2013 this is why the meteorologist is wrong on his decision the land is the one that need fixing not some person that is wrong on his part of the argument . If the meteorologist is not the one who is right the rain is not the problem it is the land is the one that needs fixing . The community needs to help the land get to its original state and to build a barricade to stop the flooding so that it does not flow again the land has went to 75% to a decreasing 45% that is why we need to fix this problem. The reason is why we need to fix it and to Keep it from flooding anymore.",,,,A 62,"A class of students did research on the precipitation in Charleston. They made graphs showing each year and how much precipitation had fallen that year.  A meteorologist came in and examined their work and made a statement on the graphs. He said The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. But Iêm here to prove him wrong. The statement above is incorrect because according to the graphs in the year 2005 the precipitation was still pretty low. It also says in the graph that precipitation was high in the years 1963-1973, therefore the flooding would be a problem back then too so in the year 2005 it wouldnêt of been the first time this problem has arose. In the year 1973 there was a lot more natural areas then in the year 2013. Citizens are concerned because flooding can be dangerous and cause property damage. Flooding is a problem now, and itês because we have mostly developed-permeable and developed- impermeable surfaces.",,,,A 63,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces because having impermeable surfaces does not allow flood water to soak in. Therefore the water begins to pile up. The local meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because he said that the cause of Charlestonês flooding problem was an increase in precipitation. He also said that flooding did not become a problem until 2005, which is when the amount of precipitation increased. His claim is inaccurate because around 2005 on Graph 2, it shows that there were more impermeable surfaces that developed. Also, another thing to support what I am saying is that ever since 2003 the amount of impermeable surfaces steadily increases. So, with that being said, the more surfaces that water cannot pass through, the less the water drains. Whenever the meteorologist stated his claim he talked about how the annual amount of precipitation and snowfall increased, however, he did not talk about the natural, developed-permeable, and the developed-impermeable surfaces and how they played a part in Charlestonês flooding problem. Evidence supporting my claim is, The annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. This shows that the meteorologist did not talk about Graph 2 (different surfaces). Also, another piece of evidence to support my claim is that on Graph 2, at 2003 the amount of developed-impermeable surfaces is at 21, and afterwards it steadily increases. Proving that the developed-impermeable surfaces were the cause of Charlestonês flooding problem, due to the fact that an impermeable surface does not allow for the water to pass through.",3,4,4,4A 64,There have been increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces and there doesnêt have to be that many areas with those kinds of surfaces because if the water doesnêt have an opening to where it needs to go then it will just go to a different place and most likely that could be a bad thing. Thatês what is causing the floods; the water is going where it shouldnêt because there are so many impermeable surfaces blocking it from where it needs to go. The meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because itês not all the impermeable surfaces it is also some natural areas that have been having troubles too. Itês not just the impermeable surfaces with the precipitation problem; it is also the natural areas that are getting a little too much precipitation and thatês making it flood. They need to have way more permeable surfaces to allow the water to go through places that need it most and not flooding the rest of the areas that donêt need it most.,,,,A 65,"The city of Charleston was founded in the early 1900, and has grown a lot over the past 10 years. The city has built three new schools and many homes along with expanding existing roads and building more sidewalks and parking lots. But the people living in Charleston have noticed that every time it rains that the city gets flooded, and this started a problem in the little city of Charleston. Up until the big flood in 2005 the the local middle schools kids were doing serval different test to figure out the problem on why Charleston has flooded. The meteorologist said that it was precipitation that was causing the problem. But really that wasnêt the problem because there were a lot roads and buildings in 2013 so the water had not where to go so it kept building up caused the flood, but way back then there was no flooding because there was more land so the more it rained the water could just seep into the ground causing less to no floods.  ",2,4,3,4A 66,"The population of Charles town has been having growing concerns about flooding in the city that has been starting to occur more frequently ever since the year 2005. One local meteorologist has come out and said the reason the city has been flooding more is, because there has been a steady increase of precipitation since 2005. Many other people like me though believe that the flooding has been growing because of the growing number of developed-impermeable surfaces. These are surfaces that do not allow water to run through them so water has nowhere to go. If what the meteorologist is saying is true then that means that Charlestown should have been flooding constantly back when Precipitation levels where at about 58% back around the 1970s, but the flooding problems had just started back in 2005. This doesnêt make since though because Precipitation levels were much lower than in the 1970s than in 2005. So the only logical reason that it would be flooding now is because the water has nowhere to go, because the percentage of impermeable surfaces has gone up about 23%. Now water can  no longer can drain out after a storm like it could in the 1970s so thatês the real reason that more floods are occurring because the growing number of impermeable surfaces are not letting water through not because there is more rain. While the meteorologist is correct that precipitation levels are rising. That is not the reason the city is flooding more because, remember that water levels were way higher in the 1970s than they were than in 2005 yet floods were occurring in 2005 not the 1970s this is because the water had places to drain out back then like in grass but now the water has nowhere to go because the city is growing so the percent of Impermeable places are growing. ",,,,A 67,"The Worldês deserts are a dry place and nothing can survive, but letês talk about Charlestown. The city of Charles was a city in development and as it grew so did the needs of the growing population and with that came many things. For example, houses needed to be built and roads paved. The city over looked one mistake and that was the chance of flooding. The city lack the knowledge to know how bad a flood was coming until it finally happen and the city was in trouble. Local middle school students did the research, but made mistakes. The students did get great work but didnêt quite figure out the problem. The students said the issue was precipitation which wasnêt the case. As the city grew so did its use of resources and the city lowered the amount of natural areas. The natural areas help decrease the chance of flooding because of the grass. During 2005 the precipitation did increase as well. The precipitation rate drop drastically during the years of 1983 and 1997. After the ninetyês and eightyês the precipitation slowly increased making the rain fall a lot more usual then normal. Leaving the city in a shower. So after analyzing the data the meteorologist was wrong. The development of impermible surfaces was not the problem. The real issue was the lack of natural areas. The city is fine at were itês at.",,,,A 68,"The meteorologist said that the reason for the increase of flooding in Charleston since 2005 was due to the increase in precipitation in Charleston since 2005. The meteorologist was incorrect when he said this. There has been more flooding in Charleston due to the growing amount of Impermeable surfaces and receding number of Permeable and natural surfaces. It is clear that the meteorologist is incorrect because the graph titled Precipitation in land Area Coverage in Charleston (1963-2013) shows that in 1973, the amount of precipitation was higher than it was in 2005. Since there was no flooding problem in 1973, it goes to show that increase in precipitation is not the reason for the increase in flooding. It is also apparent he is wrong because Charleston has grown a lot over the last 10 years. The increasing number of impermeable surfaces would provide good reason to believe that there would be an increase in flooding. The graph titled Changes in land Area Coverage in Charleston supports the idea of the growing amount of Impermeable surfaces and receding number of Permeable and natural surfaces because it shows that in 1973, the land was only 13% developed impermeable and in 2013 it was 36%. This huge increase in impermeable surfaces could easily cause more flooding.",,,,A 69,"Many people are wondering why Charleston is flooding so much. Many people say it is because the amount of precipitation Charleston gets has increased. Which this one meteorologist says but that person may be wrong. Yes, if we have a bigger increase is rain there is more rain that they have to get rid of but that rain needs a place to go, which is peopleês homes, buildings, and streets.  Charlestonês flooding problems are because there are a lot of buildings and pavement and not enough parks, felids, and nature to absorb all that water. Ever since 2005 the amount of rain has increased but the amount of plants that can absorb the water has decreased. So the water is rising and flooding homes. But meteorologists say it is because the increases in rain that Charleston has been getting. Well if that rain had somewhere to go and be absorbed instead of flooding the streets. So if Charleston wants to say hi to unflooded homes and streets the need to increases the amount of space that can absorb water instead of holding it. ",2,4,3,3A 70,"The meteorologistês claim is not correct because the increased amount of precipitation isnêt the cause of the excessive flooding. The rain and snow would not cause flooding if there were more permeable surfaces in the area. This is evident in Graph 1. In 1963 there was just under 60 inches of rain, and there was no issue with flooding. In 2005 however, there was only around 35 inches of water, and there was a flooding problem. I believe that Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Looking at Graph 2, you can see that the amount of natural area is rapidly decreasing, and the gap between Developed-Permeable Surfaces and Developed-Impermeable Surfaces is readily increasing. This gap has made it impossible for all of the water to be soaked up, leaving it to sit and flood the city. ",,,,A 71,"There are a lot of reasons towns and places flood, such as improper draining systems, or even a simple increase in precipitation. However, for the city of Charleston, it was neither of these things that have been wreaking havoc upon its citizens. For the quickly developing town of Charleston, there is simply too much of just that, development. There are no longer enough permeable surfaces to soak up the influx of water, causing the flooding the town has recently experienced. A local meteorologist that was called in on the issue is obviously wrong. He claimed that, The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. While the meteorologist is certainly correct about an increase in precipitation, he failed to mention the drastic increase in Developed-Impermeable Surfaces that have begun to pop up in Charleston. In 2013 alone, the number of Developed-Impermeable Surfaces has nearly doubled what they were just 10 years before; in 2003.That alone is an extremely important fact because without all the pre-existing natural land in the town, the water can no longer be soaked into the ground allowing it to pool up, causing all the flooding. Overall, the town of Charleston has a problem that needs to be fixed. They should set up some kind of water draining system to allow excess water a channel to escape through. Floods can be devastating and before one truly takes its toll on the town, a solution needs to be brought to the publicês eye. ",3,4,4,4A 72,Charleston flooding problems were to increases in developed lands . I am going to say my reasons why I claim this . then I am going to tell and the evidence that I found by reading in the paper. Tell why the local meteorologistês claim in inaccurate . I think that if they flood does take all the ground away then the people can make more room for farms and animals . and they can build houses for they can live in if they donêt have one. That they years went up then they went down because of the flood but it is going back up . From 1973 it was down really low then when it got to 2013 it went back up . that people need more room to farm or but animals because some people  have small space and they cant but all their stuff if its to small. That they need sidewalks and more schools for the kids  or teenagers can learn to go to college and stuff  like that . And maybe all of the lakes and ponds they can drain some of the water out for they will not get floods . because if they drain a lot of water out they when it rains it can full back up and they they will drain it then they will not have to worry about any floods and maybe for they lakes they can build a dam for they can let the water out and the water can go to some other river or something. ,,,,A 73,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The meteorologistês argument is inaccurate because he says that the increased precipitation has led to local flooding, but that is not the case.  It has simply been flooding because of the amount of growing and building the city has done. There used to be plenty of space for all of the rain to go when it  rained, but now since the city has built three new schools, many homes, new roads, sidewalks, and parking lots, there isnêt as much space left for the rain to be put in the ground. Before all of the expansion of the city happened, there was plenty of space all over for the rain to meet the ground and therefore be soaked into the ground but now thereês barely any space left because all the ground has been covered by numerous amounts of assault, concrete, etc. The meteorologistês argument was inaccurate because of the logic that was used. He says that the cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation, but that cannot be the case. In the graphs put together by the students, it shows that the precipitation in 1963 was the same amount as the precipitation in 2013. Charleston flooded in 2013, but it did not flood in 1963. If the precipitation in the same then it would have flooded in 1963 as well, this is what proves that the meteorologistês argument was not valid. ",4,3,4,4A 74,"The meteorologistês claim is inaccurate. In 1973 there was a very high amount of precipitation, almost the same exact amount thatês happening in 2013. It is very unlikely that the cause of the flood is because the huge amount of precipitation. In 2005 when it started flooding, the amount of precipitation was actually close to one of the lowest amounts itês ever been before in Charleston. The real problem causing the flood would be the different kinds of surfaces around the city. From 1973-2003 the amount of natural areas were from 75-62. After 2003 it dropped down to 45. When it dropped down to 45, the developed-impermeable surfaces raised. There were only 21, but it quickly rose to 36 in just 10 years.  Also the amounts of developed-permeable surfaces have raised just a little, which shouldnêt have affected much since it was such a little amount raised just like every other year. The main cause of the flood is the city not having enough natural areas for the rain to go, which it needs. Another cause would be too much developed-impermeable surfaces around the city. With too much of it the rain, snow, sleet etc. has nowhere else to go. Since it cannot sink into the surface it will have to stay on top of the surface causing a flood. In 2013 the natural areas are only nine away from the developed-impermeable surface. If the amount of natural areas keep lowering and the amount of developed-impermeable surfaces keep rising, then there is a good chance the city of Charleston will no longer be a city, because the flooding will just keep getting worse and worse if they do not make a change soon. ",3,3,4,4A 75,With the increase of precipitation the town Charlestonês has be seeing more flooding starting to accrue in 2005. With the population growing the town has more impermeable surfaces causing the water to sit and not soak into the ground causing the flooding. But the increase of people could be the problem that the town in having not the increase in precipitation because on the graph that I have been given it shows that the townês precipitation was increased around 1963 but they werenêt having a problem with flooding. In 1963 the town had more natural areas for the water to soak into allowing it not to be able to flood. In 2003-2013 the natural areas have decreased a bunch and a lot more impermeable surfaces have been built. The argument could go both ways for either the students or the local meteorologist. Because the town has been seeing the increase of precipitation but the town also has been seeing an increase in population. So either of these problems could be causing the problem. ,4,4,0,1A 76,The information in the story talks about what the Charleston group thinks about all the floodingês and what they can do about the land areas to decrease the flooding and I think that the city should come together and change things up  around there land  so they can Improve on not having floods anymore ,0,2,0,0A 77,"The meteorologistês argument was that the precipitation has increased therefore that is the reason why Charleston is having flooding problems. I disagree with that because it seems like he only look at one graph instead of both. In the first graph its shows the amount of precipitation and it has increased steadily but so has the developed-impermeable surfaces (areas that do not let water go through). In graph two it shows that the developed-impermeable surfaces have increased whereas the natural areas, the places that let water go through, have decreased. In 1973 there was only 13% of developed-impermeable surfaces used and 75% of natural land. In 2013 there was 36% of developed-impermeable surfaces and 45% of natural areas left. So as the precipitation is increasing so is the land that wonêt let water go through, which leaves resting water that can build up to be a flood. And if the precipitation keeps on increasing and  if Charleston doesnêt get more natural land or make more developed-permeable surfaces (areas that will allow water to go through) the floods will continue to grow worse.",4,4,4,4A 78,"In Charleston every time it rained heavily the people noticed that it starts to flood. Flooding was never a problem for Charleston until about 2005, but the floods have increased since then. Most of the citizens were worried because flooding can be very dangerous and cause damage. The students collected data about the cityês precipitation over the last 50 years and the amount of land used for different purposes. In 1973 the natural areas it was 75% in the developed permeable surfaces was 12%. The Meteorologists are incorrect because the changes in the land areas never went over 75% and the lowest it ever went was to 45% in the natural areas , and the lowest it went in the permeable was 12%. the floods were never to serious to cause major damage.  ",1,2,3,0A 79,"A local middle school science class is investigating why there city of Charleston has a growing precipitation level. This is causing more flooding. That causes people in the city to worry about property damage or worse. I think that the average precipitation has increased over time. Also the natural areas are getting smaller from buildings are getting bigger and more are being built. This make it where the water has no place to go but into the city and on to man made things. The flooding is caused by the more manmade objects in the city. More things you put closer together it makes it hard for the water to drain off. That causes flooding in the city. If people would stop building they would see that the average flooding would come to about the same amount each time. The more increased developed land areas cause more flooding from impermeable surfaces  I believe the meteorologist claim is inaccurate. I think this because the rain have be heavy or light but, the changes of the land and building cause different data. He didnêt conclude that into his data. He only thought of the rain percentage. If you put the development of cities and towns into the data, the data would be completely different. I believe there is more flooding from the more building and pavements. This causes all the water to run off to manmade things. For example like a soccer field. If we would take out most large objects the water would be able to reach lakes and rivers but the manmade objects and blocking the water from going there. This can cause water damage and other terrible things. If they live in valleys or anything low it can cause more damage.  It just depends on where the buildings are. How much water there is what season it is and other things. That is why you need  to understand the land. ",,,,A 80,I am here to argue on why the meteorologist is right and you are wrong for trying to disprove him. You say the meteorologist is wrong about his/her work well I think may just change your mind for you so then we can both think he/she is right. First off why the meteorologist is right is because he/she says that it is an increase of precipitation is water and why wouldnêt it be that? He/She also states that it has increased recently due to precipitation The annual precipitation data shows that rain and snowfall in the areas have steadily since about 2005. He also says that the flooding did not increase until 2005 which he also states that is because precipitation had led to local areas making it flood.                                                                         ,2,2,0,0A 81,"The city of Charleston has been growing and growing for the past 10 years. Recently flooding has become an issue in the city. After a local middle school science class studied the cityês land use a precipitation patterns, they figured out that there has been a huge increase in developed- Impermeable surfaces in the city. According to a local meteorologist the flooding of the city has been caused by the growing rate of precipitation. He claims that the precipitation has had a steady increase since 2005 and that flooding had not become a problem until 2005, but the real problem is how the city is using their land. The growing city of Charleston has been expanding their city for the last 10 years by developing permeable surfaces, impermeable surfaces, and leaving some of the natural surfaces. After the local school science class studied the land use and precipitation and recorded their data, you can see very clearly in the charts that the amount of developed impermeable surfaces has increased rapidly from 2003 to 2013. While the precipitation has also increased, that is not the main problem. The water from the precipitation does not have as much space to go through, due to the huge amount of impermeable surfaces in the city. While it can go through the permeable and natural surfaces, there are not as many of those since 2003 when the impermeable surfaces increased.  The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. This local meteorologist is not incorrect, but he isnêt fully looking at all of the factors in the city. The increase in precipitation is a cause of the recent flooding problems, but it is not the main cause. The increase of the impermeable surfaces are decreasing the amount of land that the water can seep into, therefore causing the water to stay above surface and causing the land to flood.  The increased flooding in Charleston during the past 10 years has many different factors that have caused in. Not only has the land expanded into much more impermeable space, but there has also been a huge increase in precipitation rates. The city has taken away all of the area for the water to go into the ground.  While the precipitation has had a mass jump and almost doubled in annual inches, the real problem is that all this precipitation has nowhere to go.  If the city would have added more permeable surfaces and kept more of the natural surfaces, then the increase of precipitation would not have affected the city as much, and the flooding would not have become a problem. ",4,4,4,4A 82,"In Charlestonês there is a flooding problem. In Charleston the flooding is changes the land and the land will increases over the years. Like in 1973 75% of natural areas changed.  Also 12% of developed-permeable surfaces were destroyed and 13% of developed-impermeable surfaces. Then in 2013 45% of natural areas were changed, 19% of developed-permeable surfaces, and 36% developed-impermeable surfaces changed. In 2013 natural areas went down but the others went up! As the years go by natural areas, developed-permeable surfaces and developed impermeable surfaces can go down. A lot of land is changing throughout the years but it is going down. The local meteorologistês is inaccurate. They are inaccurate because in 2005 the developed-permeable surfaces and developed-impermeable surfaces were low. But in 2013 they went up. In 1973 there was a problem but not as bad in 2005. In 1973 there were a lot of natural areas that got destroyed. But in 2005 there were more of developed-permeable surfaces and developed-impermeable surfaces that got destroyed. In 2013 there has been more damage than the other years.  Even though the natural areas werenêt that bad. Charleston has had a lot of flooding problems over the year and a lot of damage. ",,,,A 83,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increased developed land because of the impermeable surfaces.  The reason Charleston is flooding more than it has flooded in the past is due to the developed- impermeable surfaces like sidewalks, buildings and roads.  In ten years, more schools and more houses have been built. When more schools and houses have been built there is a lesser amount of grass and forest areas due to the fact of the schools and houses taking up more space. From 1973 to 2013, the percent of natural areas has gone down thirty percent. Whereas, the percent of the developed- Impermeable surfaces has gone up twenty-four percent.  The local meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because they claim that the cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is due to the increased amount of precipitation, which is not the reason. Even though Charleston has gotten a lot more precipitation over the years, the flooding is due to there being more of the developed- impermeable surfaces.  The graph that was shown showed that in 2013 (the highest percent of the developed impermeable surfaces) was at twenty-six percent and that the average precipitation was at sixty inches.  Even though there was more precipitation, there was more impermeable surfaces so that precipitation had no where else to go, so the city got flooded. ",3,4,4,4A 84,"Flooding is a difficult problem and should be taken care of in Charleston. The residents need a solution. For it to be fixed, the students that are investigating must first know the real cause of the increase in flooding. The meteorologistês claim is inaccurate. He says that the flooding is only because of the increase in precipitation. This is not true, though. According to the graph, between 1963 and 1973, there was about the same amount of precipitation as there has been from 2005 to now. However, the flooding has only been a problem now since 2005, and it wasnêt a problem from 1963-1973. That means something else is the cause of the current floods. He didnêt think about the changes in the land area coverage. Charlestonês floods are due to the fact the amount of developed-impermeable land areas has increased and the amount of natural areas has decreased. The second graph shows that over the years, the amounts of developed-impermeable and developed-permeable land areas have both increased. It shows that the amount of natural land areas has significantly decreased. This evidence is the cause of the flooding because natural areas absorb a lot of precipitation, therefore preventing the floods in the past, but developed-impermeable areas donêt absorb any of the snow or rain. Now that there is less natural land areas and more impermeable ones, there are less places for the precipitation to go, thus the flooding happens. Charlestonês floods are caused by the increase in the amount of developed-impermeable land areas and the decrease in the amount of natural areas. Now that the students know the cause of the flooding in their town, they and others can begin to take steps to fix it. They could try to create more natural land areas by planting lots of trees and vegetation in certain areas, or they could try to decrease the amount of developed- impermeable land areas and stop making new ones. In addition, a new type of draining system could be created for the city of Charleston. Whichever way they choose to fix it, the flooding in Charleston can now be fixed.",4,4,4,4A 85,"The meteorologist claims that the cause to the flooding is the amount of precipitation. Yes it is true that there has been an increase in precipitation over the past 10 years, but that doesnêt mean that itês the cause of the flooding. He claims Flooding didnêt become a problem for the city until 2005, but according to the precipitation patterns, flooding was a problem back in 1973 as well.  There was a lot of natural land present at that time with very little impermeable-developed surfaces. In 2013 there are more impermeable-developed surfaces, but with more flooding. So what does this tell you? Itês not because of the precipitation. Impermeable-developed surfaces are surfaces that humans have created with materials that donêt allow water to go through. This includes sidewalks, buildings, and roads. Permeable-developed surfaces are areas that humans created with materials to allow water to run through them. An example is a soccer field covered with grass. These materials are the cause of the flooding. The impermeable materials, for example a building, allow water to run off of them and into a place where water is allowed. The water then runs off into, for example, a soccer field. The water keeps running off of the building and onto the soccer field until it stops raining. Eventually this causes the field to flood. When there was a lot of natural land in Charleston, there was a lot of flooding. Thatês because the land would just soak it all up, and then would flood. As impermeable and permeable materials started to be made, the flooding went down. Then in 2013, there was almost the same amount of impermeable materials as there was natural land. This was causing the flooding because of all the surfaces that couldnêt absorb water. The water has to go somewhere, and it just happened to go to the natural land where water is absorbed. ",4,4,4,4A 86,The amount of rain might be a lot higher after 2005 but it had also been that high before. They also donêt have as much natural areas after 2003 it starts to rapidly go down as developed permeable surfaces and developed impermeable surfaces go up making it  a lot harder for the rain to absorb in to the ground causing more floods. The meteorologist just could also be right though because  if it rained all the time the water  would eventually not be able to absorb in the ground and cause  more flooding. But just the amount of rain donêt mean anything if there a open fields because the rain will absorb but if you make those fields in to towns or more of a city it give it the more chance to flood with the rain just going in the storm drains but eventually they will over flood causing more flooding.,,,,A 87,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. I think the local meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because flooding is not caused by more precipitation. There was more precipitation since 2005 but that is not the reason for the flooding. I believe the flooding is due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Ever since about 2005 the increase in impermeable surfaces is a lot more significant compared to the increase in inches of precipitation. First of all, flooding cannot be due to increased precipitation because floods cannot be caused by about 20 inches more rain in the span of 8 years. Flooding due to increased precipitation would have to have a lot more than that ratio. There would have to be more inches of rain increased in a shorter amount of time for it to cause flooding all of a sudden. Floods canêt just happen in that long span of time with on that amount of increase. Second of all, I think the flooding was caused by increased developed impermeable surfaces. I think this because the percentage went up a lot in the same span of time the precipitation increased, but the surfaces make a lot more of a difference because the water can fill up a lot faster and flood a lot easier due to surfaces and water and make flooding increase a lot more.  The surfaces most likely made curved surfaces that would hold up water a lot more and caused flooding a lot easier than before. This would have caused a lot mo0re flooding than just a few more inches of rain. Lastly, the flooding was caused by increased developed impermeable surfaces and not precipitation. I believe this claim because the surfaces make a bigger difference than a little more rain. A few more inches of rain doesnêt compare to a big percentage difference in increased impermeable surfaces. Again, surfaces make a lot more difference because they hold up the water a certain way and rain just sink into the ground depending on the surface. So really, the surface plays a lot bigger of a role than the increased precipitation. In conclusion, I think flooding was caused by increased developed impermeable surfaces and not increased precipitation. I believe this because surfaces play a bigger role than increased precipitation.  The surfaces hold up the water and the water depends on the surface, so flooding was caused especially by impermeable surfaces being increased. ",4,4,4,3A 88,"Charlestonês flooding problem is because of the impermeable surfaces being created all over the town. Impermeable surfaces are areas that humans have created with materials that do not allow water to go through like sidewalks, buildings, and roads. If water canêt go through the land then there will be no place for it to go there for flooding happens. First of all, in graph two in 1973 there was most nature covered land but as it went on to 2005 and so on it got worst as more humans were building more sidewalks, buildings, and roads. The meteorologists claim is inaccurate because he said the flooding was due to increases in the precipitation. It should actually be the increase in the impermeable surfaces. Yes, the precipitation has increased but that is not the problem of flooding if there werenêt as many buildings and roads then the water could flow off to the lakes, rivers, and streams. The impermeable surfaces are the reason for the flooding not the precipitation increases. The flooding problem since 2005 is not because if the precipitation but the amount of impermeable surfaces being added on in that town. If the water has no place to go then it will settle in one spot and have no place to go because of the buildings. To make the flooding stop they need to make more paths for the water to flow.",,,,A 89,"The meteorologist, in his argument about the Charleston flooding, stated that The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is from the increased precipitation. When looking at the graph that the students made about Annual Average Precipitation, around 1973 they had almost the same amount of precipitation (51-57) as they did around the year 2013 (45+) . Yes, they did have an increasingly amount of rainfall from 2005-2015, but if they still had permeable surfaces like they did in 1973 to around 2005, flooding would not be the problem. The real reason as to why the town of Charleston is flooding so often is due to the increases of developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. When reading the article about the flooding problem, it stated that Charleston increased in population by adding many homes and schools. Along with schools and homes, they added on to roads and made many more roads and those things are impermeable. As many may know, impermeable means that things do not soak through so when it rained. So water from when the rained just sat in the road and caused it to flood. Also, when I looked at the first graph made by the students, as I said above, the rain amount was about the same amount in 1973 and in 2005. Also, in the second graph in 1973, they had more Natural areas, therefore 75% of the precipitation soaked through, but in 2013, they had about the same amount of impermeable surfaces as they did natural area so therefore the precipitation did not soak  through and that is what caused the town of Charleston to flood. ",4,4,4,4A 90,"The claims made by the meteorologist that read as follows, The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data shows that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 20015. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding., Is false. The reason this claim is false is because in about 1963 there was an average precipitation of about 69 in. There was no reported flooding during this time. In 2013 there is also a recorded 69 in. of precipitation. The only thing that can explain the sudden flooding would be the changes in land area coverage in Charleston. I believe that the rise in developed-impermeable surfaces from 2003 to 2013 is to blame for the flooding. I also believe that this combined with the large decrease in natural areas is also to blame. This would mean that Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. I believe that the impermeable surfaces are causing water to back up because water is not able to flow through them as well as it is able to through a forest or soccer field.  From 2003 to 2013 there have been 15 more developed-impermeable surfaces, 2 more developed-permeable surfaces, and 17 less natural areas. Back in 1973 there was a very similar precipitation average of 69 in. the only difference between these two years is that is 1973 there were 75 natural areas, 12 developed-permeable areas, and 13 developed-impermeable areas. In 20013 there were 45 natural areas, 19 developed-permeable areas, and 36 developed-impermeable areas. Back in 1973 there was less natural and permeable land for water to flow in and less impermeable land to block the flow of water. So the solution to the flooding problem is to either make more natural areas and permeable areas or make more run offs or water reservoirs. The evidence I provided proves that Charlestonês flooding problems are caused by the increase in developed-impermeable areas and the decrease of both natural and developed-permeable areas.",4,4,3,3A 91,"The cause of Charlestonês flood problem is the fact that there are too many developed land areas with impermeable surfaces.  Some ways to stop the problem is to make a way so that the water can drain down into the dirt, where it can keep going down. The flooding is helped by the increase in precipitation, but is NOT caused by it. The percentage of developed permeable surfaces has increased from 1983-2013 by small little increments of one or two. What it means by Developed-Permeable Surfaces is a developed area where water can seep through. Itês like a soccer ball field. However, the percentage in Developed-Impermeable Surfaces has jumped in steps and leaps. In 1993 it was only 18%. Ten years later it was 21%, not that big of a jump. Then in 2013, it was a whopping 36% compared to last yearês statistics. Thatês quite a large leap. Impermeable means to not let through. When you add water, it just stays there. The meteorologists claim that the increase in rain is the cause of the increase in flooding. This is wrong. The increase in rain is not the only factor for floods. Another thing that matters is Developed-Impermeable Surfaces. These surfaces hold water on top and just leave it there, the only way for it to leave is to be evaporated. Then the water continues to build up. As the water builds up it spreads and goes all over the place. A way to stop all the flooding would be to make a way for the water to drain. Get it so that the water flows into the sewer or something, but you need a way to get rid of the water.",4,4,3,4A 92,"As mankind becomes more modernized, simple problems ranging from freak waves to insane weather can turn into bigger, more dangerous problems. The city of Charleston has recently been suffering from a problem relating to rain and flooding. Residents of the city are afraid that the heavy precipitation will cause damage to their homes. A local meteorologist presented an argument to the public but a class from a local middle school has come up with an even better solution. The meteorologistês argument that states: The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. From the surface, it looks like the meteorologist did a good job on making his claim. It seems like he knows what he was doing when he wrote this statement and you would think there would be evidence to back this claim up. I disagree with this statement. Instead I think the reason why Charleston has flooding problems is because of the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces (areas humans have created that do not allow water to go through). Letês start off by looking at changes in land area coverage in Charleston between 1973 and 2013. In 1973, 75% of land in Charleston was natural areas (areas that have not been touched by man). 12% of this land was developed, permeable surfaces (manmade surfaces that allow water to seep through) and 13% was the Developed, Impermeable surfaces. Over the years the amount of natural areas started to decrease, and the manmade surface types started to increase. By 2003, 62% of Charleston was nature areas, 17% were permeable surfaces, and 21% were impermeable surfaces. 10 years later, 45% of the land area in Charleston was natural areas, 19% were permeable surfaces, and 36% were impermeable surfaces.Now letês look at precipitation patterns, between 1963 and 1973, precipitation in Charleston was decreasing at a steady rate from 50 inches to almost 40 inches within a period of 10 years. Between 1973 and 1983, precipitation declined at a steady rate but stopped and remained at a rate between 30 inches and 40 inches. Between 1983 and 1993, the precipitation rate was going back and forth between different values but in the end, the precipitation rates ended at 30 inches for that year. Then between 1993 and 2003, precipitation rates started to skyrocket back to 35 inches by the end of 2003. Finally, between 2003 and 2013, precipitation rates skyrocketed. Starting at 35 inches and ending at almost 60 inches.The relationship between the precipitation patterns and the area coverage in Charleston tells me a lot about why the increase in flooding has become such a problem. The more that Charleston modernized the more floods it experienced. The natural areas and permeable surfaces in Charleston took in the precipitation whenever it rained or whenever it snowed.  Between 2003 and 2013, with more impermeable surfaces becoming common in Charleston, precipitation rates and flooding became more common on Charleston as well. The meteorologist is wrong because his claim that rain in Charleston increased steadily between 2005 and 2013 is wrong because the precipitation rates were skyrocketing during that period. A combination between increased precipitation and non-permeable surfaces is causing Charleston to experience more profound flooding than ever before because since those surfaces are becoming more common, and do not absorb water very well, the water has nowhere to go but on the streets. Mankind needs to improve on balancing natural areas with manmade, permeable surfaces that allow water to seep through if Charleston wants to find a possible solution to this problem. ",4,4,4,4A 93,"Charleston has been flooding a lot lately, and everyone has been forming their own opinion. Most people are thinking that Charleston is getting a lot more precipitation. Because, every time it rains heavy it floods. The real reasoning for the flooding in Charleston is because of the increase of developed land areas. If you really think about it the ground can only take in water a little at a time. And, it doesnêt help that most of the ground there is impermeable. When something is impermeable it doesnêt absorb water, it basically sheds water. So, if Charleston isnêt getting more rain then what is going on? Some people might say. It really is just all the new developed land areas like; sidewalks, streets, and buildings. None of these absorb water making it hard not to flood. All the people who thought it was just more precipitation are wrong. Most of the ground there just does not absorb water.",,,,A 94,"It is not secret Charleston has grown a lot since 900ês. This is the main reason why the flooding has grown.  People say that the precipitation patterns are the reason why Charleston is flood more often through the years. Yet they do not even observe how whenever they decrease natural areas and put up more Developed-Permeable Surfaces and Developed-Impermeable Surfaces the flooding gets worse. The reason why it gets worse to almost dangerously is because of all the space they took up. Water spreads it does not just stay in one place so for the Developed-Impermeable Surfaces is useless cause all you are doing is flooding out and killing the grass, it will not just stay in the grass it will spread. Developed-Permeable Surfaces block out the water so it has little space to go. The exits in the water that they built do not lead to a bottomless pit so where does the water go? Up, like filling up a glass of water. The water does not lay spread out for it rises and if you pour too much it flows over. That is how the flooding is working because all the exits are filled with water it will start rising and then rises over the Permeable Surfaces they made and into peopleês homes. The cause of Charlestonês Flooding Problem is not the precipitation but was for the water to go when it does rain heavily.",,,,A 95,"The flooding in Charlestown is not because of increased precipitation numbers over the years, it is because of the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Although it is true that the numbers in precipitation have gone up it does not cause the city to flood. The graph of changes in land coverage shows that the amount of natural areas has decreased since 1973 and the Developed areas permeable and non-permeable have gone up. The meteorologistês argument is inaccurate because just because the precipitation rate went up doesnêt mean that the city should be flooding especially when you bring in the factor of developed lands. The Precipitation is the highest it has ever been and the natural area in Charlestown is at the lowest ever. The flooding wasnêt a problem until 2005 when the natural areas were starting to get removed for developed impermeable surfaces along with developed permeable surfaces. In 1963 the precipitation was at around 51 and the natural area was at 75% the flooding didnêt occur until 2005 which is when the precipitation wasnêt as high as it was in 1963 when there wasnêt flooding. The land percentages however were much different from 1963 to 2005 there was much less natural land and way more Impermeable and permeable surfaces. The percentages played a huge factor into why the city is flooding. Itês safe to say that the increase of the precipitation was not the cause of the flooding but the increase in developed areas was the cause simply due to the data that is presented. The Natural area goes down precipitation stays lower than it was when flooding wasnêt an issue and it starts to become an issue. The meteorologist is not completely wrong about his theory because the increased rain plays a part in the flooding factor but is not the reason for it nor is the increased numbers.",,,,A 96,"The meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because while there was an increase in rain in inches some of that increase could have been too much rainwater going into one place and staying there for long periods of time.  The ground would have been so wet that it could not soak up any more water.  All of this water going into one place would have also been due to the large amount of the areas where water could not go through and the small amount of areas where water could move through eventually leading all of the excess rainwater into the flooded areas. Therefore the meteorologist was incorrect in assuming that the increased rainfall was the only factor in the flooding.  My argument is that the area did not start flooding until there was a significant amount of development in the city of Charlestonês waterways and buildings, shown on the graphs created by the middle school class, and a lot of the natural area had been turned into building space so that the community could continue to grow. The amount of areas where water could not go through was almost equal to the area of untouched natural land leaving a very small amount of space for the water to move and thus causing flooding in the only places that the water could move.  My evidence supports the claim because the evidence for the largest amount of water was starting to show when there was the most development to the natural land in the graphs provided by the middle school class.   ",3,3,2,1A 97,"Charlestonês flooding problems are caused by the increase in developed areas that have impermeable surfaces not the cause of more rain and snowfall. The meteorologist claims that it is because of more rain and snowfall in the area. The studentês data proves him wrong. The studentês data shows that the meteorologist is wrong and that the flooding is caused by the increase in developed areas that have impermeable surfaces. The meteorologistês claim is inaccurate. The studentês data shows that he is wrong. The students graph of the precipitation in Charleston over 50 years shows that they have had this much precipitation before. From 2005 to 2013 they have had more rain than that in the past. The rain and snowfall is increasing but it isnêt anything they have seen before. Since they have had that much rainfall before and had no flooding than it has to be something else. The studentês data proves that the meteorologistês claim is inaccurate. The studentês data also proves that Charlestonês flooding problem comes from the increase in developed areas that have impermeable surfaces. In 1973 they had only 13 percent of their land area that was developed impermeable surfaces. In 2003 they had 21 percent and in 2013 they had 36 percent of their land that was developed impermeable surfaces. In 10 years they had an increase of 15 percent of land that could not soak up the rain and snow. From 1973 to 2013 (40 years) they had an increase of 23 percent. Those are huge increases. Their flooding stared around 2005. The huge increase of developed impermeable surfaces started around then as well. The studentês data proves that the cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is from the increase in developed areas that have impermeable surfaces. The Charlestonês flooding was caused by the increase of developed impermeable surfaces, not the increase in rainfall. The studentês data proves that. The meteorologist believes that the increase in rainfall is the cause of Charlestonês flooding. The studentês data also proves that he is wrong. Their data shows that Charleston has had this much rain and snowfall before and had no problems before. It also shows that there was a huge increase from 2003 to 2013 in developed impermeable surfaces. The flooding started to happen in 2005, so that shows that there was a huge increase in developed impermeable land around that time.  ",3,2,4,2A 98,"The city of Charleston had started out small, but over the years the population got bigger and bigger. All of the citizens began to notice that flooding began in 2005, and has been having an issue with it every time it rains heavily. Some kids from a local middle school started to investigate the problem. The students began to collect data and came to the conclusion that the more land there is then the more precipitation the city will receive. After they came to this conclusion they decided to invite a local meteorologist to examine their data. The meteorologist claimed that over the past years the flooding was getting caused by the increase in the precipitation. By looking at the data I believe that the meteorologist is incorrect. The flooding is getting caused by the increase in Developed _ impermeable surface areas over the years. The kids from the local middle school divided the city into three different categories: Developed _ impermeable surfaces which are the areas that humans have created with materials that donêt allow water to go through like sidewalks, buildings, and roads. Developed _ permeable surfaces which are areas that humans have created with materials that allow water to go through like soccer fields covered with grass. Natural areas which are spaces that have not been developed by humans like forest areas.  The data the classmates collected from all three categories shows that Natural Areas has always been the highest in changes in land areas from 1973-2013. So due to the changes of land areas the more precipitation will accrue. The meteorologist had claimed that over the past years the flooding was getting caused by the increase in the precipitation. Well in the data that the local middle school classmates had gathered it shows that in 1963-1973 that the precipitation was almost as high as it is in 2013. So I disagree with the meteorologist because the precipitation isnêt causing the flooding in Charleston. ",3,4,3,3A 99, The city flooding was a big problem back in 1973. The flooding problem was at a standstill and did not have a lot of flooding in till 2005. The flooding has started up again and it was bad. All the citizens of the city where scared and where worried about the land and property damage. When they started to build more and more building the took most of the dirt and grass away. So what they need to do is that they need more drainage systems. The reason why it is flooding is because they do not have enough drainage on the road and on the sidewalks.  Here we have many systems to drain all the water off the streets and sidewalks. About 87% of grassy and dirt land but in 2005 the grassy and dirt land was moved down to 36% because of buildings. ,0,2,0,0A 100,Looking at all the research the local middle school science class has done. Its seems like that there is a constant pattern that shows on the graphs.  The pattern keeps increase as people keeps on building place in Charleston like buildings shops houses sports fields works and so on. As people start building more and more in Charleston they keep having more and more floods each and every year. As people kept on building on they did realis thatês they working rid of a lot of land that kept the town from not flooding. As the took more and more land away the water did had much places to go. What the people didnêt know was as they kept on building on to the town they got rid of a lot of good ground that kept the town from not flooding. The ground acts like a sponge itêll take up a lot of what from the rain or snow or and other precipitation. But as soon as u donêt have that land to hold the water it will flood.  ,2,4,0,2A 101,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces, I know this because in graph two the data shows that between the years of 2003 and 2013 the impermeable surfaces percentile was at 21 and is now at 36. This proving that the rate has increased a large amount over the 10 year period. I do not agree with the meteorologistês claim stating that the flooding is due to the precipitation up rise. The precipitation patterns were up just as high in 2005-2013 as they were in 1963-1973. Why were the flooding rates never like they were after 2005 before when the precipitation rate was up? This is because the flooding rates are not caused by the precipitation up rise. It was caused by increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. ",4,2,4,2A 102,The meteorologistês claim is that the Natural areas are slowly going down over the years while the Developed permeable surfaces and the Developed impermeable surfaces are going up slightly over the amount of years. The annual average precipitation rate by inches in 1973 was up in the 50 and above inches while it took a nose dive and went down to the lower 30 inches in 1983. It slightly went up in 1993 to 40 inches and rapidly grew by 2013 to 60 and above in inches. The claim is inaccurate due to the fact of the amount of developed areas with impermeable surfaces and the amount of natural areas are shrinking over the amount of years which means that humans are building more and more impermeable surfaces. Which means that most of the water is not able to pass through the surface so it will build up in amount of time which is increasing the possibility of flooding.,3,3,2,3A 103,"The meteorologistês claim that the cause of flooding in Charleston is increased precipitation is completely inaccurate. The reason behind the flooding is because of an increase in developed-impermiable surfaces and the decrease in natural areas and here is why. The meteorologist claimed that the steady rise in rain and snowfall since 2005 is the reason for the flooding problems that seem to of started in 2005. But once again this is not the case, in fact in 1973 when the natural area numbers in Charleston were the highest there was more precipitation than in the year 2005, when the natural area numbers happen to be the lowest amount recorded. This just goes to show that increased number of impermiable surfaces and the decrease of natural areas in Charleston are the actual cause of the flooding problem and has nothing to do with the precipitation levels.",,,,A 104,"I think that the water system in Charleston was good at first until the floods came in 2005 which means that the water system will increase at a constant rate. The graphs that the kids made in the middle school was somewhat right on graph one but in graph two they showed you more readings. I also think that all the floods that Charleston had was because of the permeable and impermeable surfaces started to decreased. When it started to decreased in 1973 the surfaces were not as stable as it was now because of all the floods and damaging peopleês homes. When the local wanted to know about the floods that have been going on over the past 50 years, They got a answer that they should know about it in science classes when they get to the high school. I think that local meteorologist had a motive about the floods that happened in Charleston that he wanted to find out what really happened to the surfaces.  ",2,1,0,1A 105,"I think that the meteorologistês argument is inaccurate because although the rainfall did steadily increase since 2005, the amount of land coverage has been going down. Each year since 1973 the amount of land coverage has been going down in natural areas. Even when the annual precipitation has been going down the coverage of developed permeable surfaces and impermeable surfaces have been going up. The use of impermeable surfaces is rising which is the reason for all the flooding that is coming up. Citizens taking away the natural areas is causing the city to build more impermeable surfaces therefor the water has nowhere else to go. For there to not be any flooding the permeable and impermeable surfaces must be developed at a more accurate rate. The meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because although precipitation has been going up, the reason for the flooding is too much impermeable surfaces are being created so its ratio is slowly becoming greater than that of the natural areas which is permeable.",4,3,4,4A 106,"The meteorologistês claim is inaccurate for multiple reasons. For starters, the precipitation was down over 20 inches in 2005 than in the late 1960ês early 1970ês. And we have just now reached those levels of rain in the last few years, 2012-2013. This ruleês out the precipitation being the only source of the increasing problem due to the 7-8 years of flooding that happened before the levels hit there previous heights. This leads me to my own claim; Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Looking at the data, in the early 1970ês 87% of the land was permeable. At 75% natural areas and 12%developed permeable area, only 13% would not help with absorbing precipitation. But in recent years, it has dropped to only 64% permeable area. At 45% natural land, 19% developed permeable land, and 36% developed impermeable land, less land is able to absorb water. So as the precipitation rises to and succeeds its past levels, 23% less land is soaking up water, leaving water on the surface and causing flooding. It is this 23% decrease in land that affects the increased flooding more than the few, 3-5, extra inches of precipitation yearly. The evidence provided to me with the background knowledge I had allowed me to use evidence to disclaim the meteorologist idea, and prove that it is the decreasing amount of permeable land that is causing the increased flooding of recent years.",4,4,4,4A 107,The meteorologist claims that Charlestonês flooding problem is due to increased precipitation in Charleston. Charlestonês flooding problem isnêt due to the increase in precipitation but it is due to the increase of developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The meteorologist claim is inaccurate because around 1973 Charleston received more rain than they did in 2005. Yet the flooding problem didnêt start until 2005. This is because in 1973 87% of the land could soak up the water so there wasnêt much leftover. Around 2005 the developed-impermeable surfaces started to increase and now 36% of the land is developed-impermeable surface. That means more water gets left over. This causes more flooding in the area because then all the water builds up and rises to flood the area. ,,,,A 108,I agree that the flooding is due to increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces because when it rains in flat land it tends to flood more or with land that has a lot of ponds or rivers. The meteorologist claim was wrong because in the story it said the developed impermeable surfaces are the ones that humans built that allow water to go through. The meteorologist only calculated how much rain fell over time not how the flooding increased or how it happened but the science class is more accurate with the investigation of the flooding.  They also got data about the precipitation to figure out where it came from. On the meteorologist graph it started at 50 and then it started going up and there werenêt any groups like the science class did they had their graph in groups and then they found out which one was more like the cause of the flooding and it was the developed impermeable. So I agree with the science class data that they collected.,2,2,2,3A 109,"There are a lot of reasons towns and places flood, such as improper draining systems, or even a simple increase in precipitation. However, for the city of Charleston, it was neither of these things that have been wreaking havoc upon its citizens. For the quickly developing town of Charleston, there is simply too much of just that, development. There are no longer enough permeable surfaces to soak up the influx of water, causing the flooding the town has recently experienced. A local meteorologist that was called in on the issue is obviously wrong. He claimed that, The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. While the meteorologist is certainly correct about an increase in precipitation, he failed to mention the drastic increase in Developed-Impermeable Surfaces that have begun to pop up in Charleston. In 2013 alone, the number of Developed-Impermeable Surfaces has nearly doubled what they were just 10 years before; in 2003.That alone is an extremely important fact because without all the pre-existing natural land in the town, the water can no longer be soaked into the ground allowing it to pool up, causing all the flooding. Overall, the town of Charleston has a problem that needs to be fixed. They should set up some kind of water draining system to allow excess water a channel to escape through. Floods can be devastating and before one truly takes its toll on the town, a solution needs to be brought to the publicês eye. ",3,4,4,4A 110,"I think that I disagree with the meteorologist because there could be so many other reasons why the town keeps flooding. The seasons donêt have the same weather every year. Every season every year is completely different. Like here in Mexico one winter it snowed like 15 inches and the following winter it only snowed one time and the snow didnêt even stick to the ground. But any how what Iêm trying to get at is just because we have one bad season doesnêt mean that all that the seasons are going to be like that. On the graph it shows that the annual average of the precipitation in 1963 was about 51 or 52. Later on in the year the average of precipitation started to drop. In 1973 there were 50 inches. The numbers just keep dropping because in1983 the average precipitation was 34 and the numbers just keep getting lower and lower. Every season every year has different weather. In the bar graph the meteorologist was determining the percentage of different surfaces the 3 different surfaces are natural areas, developed-permeable surface, and developed-impermeable surfaces. In 1973the percentage for natural areas was 75. The percentage for developed-permeable surfaces was 12, and the percentage for developed-impermeable surfaces was 13. Now for the year of 1983 the percentage of natural areas is 72. The percentage for developed-permeable surfaces was 12, and the percentage for developed-impermeable surfaces was 15. This is why I disagree with what the meteorologist said.",2,1,2,0A 111,"Once upon a time, Charleston was an inventive city. The city was building schools, homes, sidewalks and parking lots. All of this was to satisfy their booming population which was beginning to blossom. Everything was smooth sailing. As time wore on something in the air just wasnêt quite right.  Unfortunately for the people of Charleston, there were too many dark and stormy nights. The people began to notice the growing flood problem. The floods were becoming treacherous and damaging. No one knew what to do or why this was happening. No one knew, until now. After years of research on the schoolês part, a meteorologist observed their work and believes he has the reason of why there has been such a drastic change in flooding. However, this solution is deeply flawed. Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed areas with impermeable surfaces rather than more rainfall. Since 1963, rainfall has increased, decreased and has begun to climb again. Rain is one part of the equation but not the reason behind this predicament. Since 1973, more and more natural lands have decreased and more developed- impermeable surfaces have increased. These kind of surfaces have materials that do not allow water to go through them. The only remaining question is where does the water go? For example this would be like there is a clog in a dam. The water builds up and eventually floods. That is exactly what happens to the water that cannot pass through the impermeable surfaces. As stated above, these kind of surfaces are increasing in the Charleston area. This is one main reason of why the meteorologistês claim is inaccurate and the floods in this area so frequent. On the other hand the meteorologist is correct on one account. Rainfall has increased. What he claims from this point on is not accurate for Charleston. He claims, Increased precipitation has led to local flooding. This alone cannot cause flooding. There have to be other factors. If this was the case, jungles would be under the ocean by now. The reason why jungles arenêt and the reason why Charleston has flooding is because, natural areas that allow water to go through them are steadily decreasing. As stated above, with impermeable surfaces, the water has to go somewhere. Now this is not to say that Charleston doesnêt have developed-permeable surfaces because there are such surfaces in Charleston. However, there are not nearly enough of these kinds of surfaces as there are impermeable areas. Since this is so, flooding is more prone to happening. Charlestonês flooding problems are not due to increased rainfall as the meteorologist claims, but because there are more surfaces where water cannot pass through. ",,,,A 112,The meteorologistês claim was wrong because the problem isnêt the precipitation. It is the lack of natural land that has not been affected by people. The lack of land means that not as much moisture can be absorbed by the ground. The meteorologist failed to analyze the situation properly; he never put the populationês growth into thought. ,1,3,3,0A 113,"Charleston has had a recent flooding problem since 2005. The flooding is caused by land areas with impermeable surfaces. The meteorologistês argument was false because they had lots of precipitation in 1963. They had almost the same amount of precipitation as they do today. This proves them wrong because they said The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation when it is actually due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The precipitation has been eroding the land and moving it, which is making it flatter then it doesnêt drain fast enough then it floods. ",,,,A 114,Well the claim is inaccurate because it says that the flooding started in 2005 but that was not a problem until 2005. I honestly donêt think it is accurate because of many reasons. Like one reason is because the 1st graph shows that it is high in the years of 1963 to 1973. Then it drops really low in around 1938. Then it rises about 10 to 20 inches then drops again. Then in the years of 2003 and 2013 it rises all the way up. So I then again think that it started flooding really bad around 2003-2004 instead of 2005. Another reason is because of the graph. The paper says it started in early 2005 but it got worse throughout 2005 I think that  mid late 2004ês it started but nobody really seemed to care but then it got worse over the year and people started to get more and more serious with the problem. Like in 2005 they started to actually take notice to the flooding. So maybe they are not inaccurate.  They are not fully accurate but I wouldnêt say theyêre fully accurate either.   ,,,,A 115,"Charleston, a town founded in the early 1900s, developed flooding problems beginning in 2005. After suffering the destruction said floods have to offer, a local middle school has decided to find the source of their worries and woes. With the information they gathered, the students created two graphs; one showing rainfall of Charleston, one showing the changes in land coverage. With ever-changing precipitation patterns and an increased developed-permeable and impermeable surface area the class quickly jumped on the chance of inviting a local meteorologist to examine their data. The meteorologist came to the conclusion that the cause of the floods was the increase of precipitation. I am here to prove that wrong. Looking at the data recorded by the students in the first graph, Iêve noticed a drastic change in precipitation. A drop from 1970-1983, a hill-like rise and fall from 1985-1993, and a major incline starting in 2005. Precipitation? Possibly, but not definite. Looking at the second graph, I see that the developed impermeable surface has skyrocketed from 12% in 1973 to 19% in 2013. Hence, my argument. The developed impermeable surfaces has caused the immense rainfall to flood the town. ",3,2,4,2A 116,The local flooding of Charleston was not caused by the increase of precipitation like the local meteorologist claimed to be the reason for the flooding in the town of Charleston but by the increase of developed land area with impermeable surfaces. Looking at graph 1 that shows precipitation patterns in Charleston from 1963-2013 you can see that there has not been any increase in precipitation over the years. The local meteorologist said that the increase of precipitation did not become a problem until 2015 which is inaccurate because the graph shows that from the year 1963 to 2005 the precipitation decreased until 2015 to where it gets back up to where it was before the decrease. The flooding of Charleston is due to the increase of Developed-Impermeable areas because water cannot get through those surfaces so the water stays in certain areas instead of draining or evaporating because there is too much of it in one area. If there were more Developed-Permeable areas and more Natural areas and less Developed-Impermeable areas the town of Charleston would not being having flooding problems due to the fact that the water would not be getting trapped in areas because it has nowhere to flow. The water would be seeping through that earth and the water would be getting evaporated. The flooding of the town Charleston is in fact not caused by the increase of precipitation but by the increase of the town of Charleston increasing impermeable surfaces. ,3,4,3,4B 117,"The city of Charleston has been having flooding issues because people or the workers have developed-impermeable surfaces. Flooding has never been a problem for Charleston until 2005, but the floods have increased in frequency ever since.  Students are investigating this in a middle school science class.  They have collected data about the cityês precipitation over the last 50 years and the amount of land used for different purposes.  Measures of precipitation indicate how much rain and snow the city receives. The precipitation patterns from 1963 to 2013 have increased by a lot.  In 1963 precipitation was about 58 in. and for 2013 it was 60 in.  It has increased by a lot ever since.  Natural areas in Charleston have decreased from 1973 to 2013.  There have been more developed-impermeable surfaces since then that is why the city has been having so much flooding.  That city needs to have more permeable surfaces so that water can go through and not cause any flooding.  Permeable surfaces have increased to from 1973 to 2013, but just by a little bit.   They should tell some of the workers to start developing permeable surfaces in the places they can so they city wont get flooded.  The cause of Charleston flooding is the increased precipitation.  The annual precipitation data shows that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005.  The city is going to keep on flooding if you keep on putting more sidewalks, buildings, and parking lots, the water has nowhere to go.  I think that they should stop building buildings and start putting more permeable surfaces.",3,2,0,0B 118,The Charleston flooding problem are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The meteorologist is wrong because the precipitation went down in 1963-1973. And in 1963-1973 the flooding went down a lot. I think the reason is that there is so many floods is because the natural areas. The are building buildings on impermeable surfaces that make the water flood. The city floods every time it rain because it heavily rain and they donêt have nothing to stop the rain it sounds like. The flooding has been around for 50 years or so. In 1963 to 1973 the flooding went down. Then 1983 it went up. but in 2013 the town of Charleston has seen there most floods of all time. The solution is to let the water go throw. And they need to stop building on impermeable surfaces cause that why it flood because the water has no where to go. they need to make something so the water will go in to a creek or something so the town will not get flood no more. if there stuff keeps flood maybe they should not build it there.,,,,B 119,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces because the water has no way to get out, the water just builds. The Developed-impermeable surfaces are places or areas that people have created like building and pavement, and sidewalks that water canêt go through. So it just builds up. But then there is other areas called Developed-permeable areas that water can go through like fields and grassy areas. The local meteorologistês claim is inaccurate, he/she said that The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data shows, that rain and snowfall in the area increased steadily since 2005.

In 2003 the D-IS was 21, In ten years it was re counted and the D-IS was 36. The rain has also increased since 2005, but with the more D-IS the rain has less places to seep into the ground at, my conclusion is that the flooding problems have came from the more D-IS and the lack of drainage.",,,,B 121,"Charleston is having a flood problem and this just happened recently. Flooding in Charleston hasnêt been this bad since the mid 60s. Our graphs and collected data show that. In fact itês the worst it has ever been and, the people of Charleston need an answer, a correct answer.  With my evidence and data Iêve gathered, I will tell you why the flooding is not because of the rise in precipitation. Many of the citizens in Charleston are very confused about the situation and they need answers.  Most of the citizens have been living most of their lives and nothing has happened to them like this. These citizens of Charleston are afraid because flooding can be very dangerous and we want to help keep them and their families safe. In the year 2013, our data has shown that natural areas have decreased on the surfaces in Charleston.  For those who donêt know what natural areas are, they are areas that have not been developed by humans.  The Developed-Impermeable Surfaces are on a rise, more than it ever has been.  This means that when it rains in Charleston, there is no way for the water to pass through or around the area so it floods. In conclusion, we need to build ways for the water to pass through Charleston or, it will continue to flood and, it will only get worse.  The flooding is not due to increased precipitation, if it was then it probably wouldnêt be as serious as it is now.

The annual precipitation data shows that rain a snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005.

The increased rainfall count has made the flooding be twice as bad, and because of the population being so big, there is less places for people to run and take shelter too.

I believe that there is a problem with flooding, because of the precipitation going up ever since the year 2005.  So every time there is a heavy poor down of rain or snow it always makes it flood, because of how large the rain and snowfall is in Charlestonês town.  Another problem is that there is less land to cover because half of the land in Charlestonês is already covered so that makes there less land to cover. The meteorologistês argument says, the the land is flooding, because there is to much rain and snowfall in Charlestonês town.  I really do believe that this argument is true.  There is nowhere for the water to go so all it does is flood the land.  There is also a problem that there has been increases in the developed land area with impermeable surfaces.  Whenever you have too much impermeable surfaces then there is nowhere for the water to go so all it does is sits and floods. There is also a lot of floods, because the town has built three new schools and many homes to meet the needs of its growing population.  They have also put in new roads, more sidewalks, and more parking lots.  So that leaves nowhere for the water to drain out of the city. The reason why the town has so much floodingês is, because they keep on making the town bigger and bigger by building new things.",3,3,0,4B 124,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. A meteorologist has explained why he believes the flooding has occurred but he failed to mention the history of Charleston he also failed to mention and the impermeable surfaces he failed to mention so although he was partly right he was also wrong hereês why. In the argument that the meteorologist prepared he said that the flooding has been caused by the increase in precipitation that Charleston has received the rain has been on a steady incline since 2005 witch was when the flooding started, but what he failed to mention was in 1973 the precipitation was almost the same height as it was during the flooding.  The difference was the amount of impermeable surfaces that was in Charleston at the time there was not near as many in 1973 as there was during the flooding so although the rain was a factor in the flooding it was not the reason it occurred the rain would fall and have no wear to go because of all the impermeable surfaces witch in turn causes flooding .So although the meteorologist was partly correct he failed to look at whole picture he only looked at the weather aspects of the problem when there was much more to it. ",,,,B 125,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. What the meteorologist said was wrong. There wouldnêt be increased precipitation. Precipitation changes very little every year. There are little rivers, ponds, and lakes in Charleston so the clouds have very little water to pick up.

The meteorologistês claim is inaccurate for simple reasons that to be quite frank are hard to miss. The meteorologist has blamed the increase in annual precipitation when actually the cause of the problem is the increase in the impermeable surfaces that have been developed. For those that do not know that means the water cannot pass through the surface that has been developed. As the years went by the number of impermeable surfaces has increased. In 1973 there were only 13 impermeable surfaces in Charleston. Then in 2013 it rose to 36 that is a difference of 23 impermeable surfaces. In 1973 there were only 12 permeable surfaces in 2013 there were 19, thatês a difference of 7. So if there are 36 impermeable surfaces and 19 permeable surfaces thatês a difference of 15. Simply put the water has very few surfaces to pass through and a lot that it cannot pass through. If you had increased the amount of permeable surfaces and reduced the impermeable surfaces than you would not have a flooding issue in Charleston. The increase in rain is only a fraction of the problem the majority of the problem is that there are so many impermeable surfaces that the water cannot pass through so it stays in the town with no way to escape but through the very few permeable surfaces that Charleston has built within the past 40 years.",,,,B 127,"The meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because the precipitation patterns in 2005 was not , it the fact that over time more Developed-permeable surfaces has be built causing natural areas to go down.

The meteorologistês claim is also inaccurate because during to 2005 the precipitation patterns were at its almost at its lowest, 2003 was the lowest it got but increased really slowly over the next 4 maybe 5 years. My claim is that the cause of the Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased of population which led to the increased of Developed-permeable surfaces being built and less and less of natural areas and Developed-impermeable surfaces can be built or remain natural areas, which is causing water to get trap and just sit there and that during that time the precipitation patterns increased from 2003 to 2006, causing more rain to come down and flood the city so easy.

The meteorologistês claim is incorrect since the precipitation was about the same amount as back then in 1970. Because of the increase in impermeable areas and the decrease in the natural areas. Precipitation may have had a part in the flooding but the areas where the water cant freely flow through are the cause of the flooding since the developed-Impermiable areas are starting to rise the water keeps getting clogged not allowing enough water to flow through fast enough causes the water to build up bit by bit can cause the flooding.",,,,B 130,"Charleston has done construction work in the year 2005, but they just started doing it in 2005 they didnêt do anything before, and since they had founded the town in 1900 that may be why the town has been flooding.

The precipitation was really good and helpful in 1963 that took a lot of it way down.

",,,,B 133,"I believe the meteorologist is incorrect. The amount of precipitation is a part of why it floods a lot but also the land is a big part to. Plus if there is a grass land then yes it will flood because the water can get threw the grass. Also, the human population everyone putting in new houses and stuff will cause flooding cause the ground will not be level. Besides when it rains the roads and stuff the water cant get threw the water goes on and on until it finds a not level spot or a grass area and it starts to flood it. Since 1973 Charleston keeps changing the land area coverage. They developed more and more impermeable areas and not a lot of permeable areas. They added a lot of natural areas though. Then they decreased in the natural areas. They got rid of them most likely because of the population had to make more homes for the families that were coming in. Which also means they had to make more permeable areas cause to build more homes you have to build roads to. Charleston didnêt have flooding problems till 2005. Thatês probably because in between the years of 2003 and 2013 was the most precipitation they got. And with all the natural areas they lost by then there wasnêt a lot of places the water could go because of course the water cant get threw the permeable places. And even though there was more impermeable places the water from the permeable places has to find its way to the impermeable places. They need to make less impermeable areas so they can make permeable places so the water cant get threw. Then, there will be less flooding.  Then with more area they can make more money and have a bigger population as well.",,,,B 134,"The increasing amount of flooding in Charleston is caused by the amount of impermeable land that has developed over the years because of the cityês growing population. Meteorologists have argued that the increasing amount of flooding is because of the amount of precipitation over the last years.

Meteorologists havenêt mentioned in their statement that the amount of natural areas have decreased because of the building of impermeable areas. The flooding in Charleston is going to get more severe if they keep taking away natural areas to stop some of the flooding. The growing population of Charleston gives a need to create more impermeable area, but at this rate the city of Charleston is going to have to manage away to decrease flooding. More permeable land can decrease the flooding but when they take away natural areas to build streets, sidewalks, and housing areas they are opening themselves up for more flooding. Charlestonês flooding problem is not being caused by the increase of rain it is because of the amount of impermeable land they have developed over the years from their increasing population.",,,,B 135,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces, the meteorologists claim that the cause of Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increased precipitation. Is false for a number of reasons. One reason is that the precipitation graph shows that the precipitation amounts are about the same between 1963-1973 are about the same as they were in 2013. The reason for the increases in the flooding isnêt because of the rain fall but instead its because of the decrease in natural areas and the increase in the developed areas the percentage of different surfaces of natural areas have decreased by 30% since 1973, and the developed-permeable surfaces have increased by 7%, the developed impermeable surfaces has increased by 23% and the impermeable surfaces added by humans are what hold the water causing the city to flood more and more every year. The reason the natural areas are important in this case are they soak up the water that gets in the dirt because the plants need water to survive so the dirt absorbs some of the water that way the plantsê roots can suck the water in through the dirt. The reason that is important is so you donêt have all the standing water that has no where to go so it just sits there until it all evaporates which if you have a decent rain the water doesnêt have anywhere to go and it cant evaporate quick enough to make room for the other rain so it just keeps piling up and then it finds way into your house whether it be through a leaking roof because someone didnêt redo the roofing or cracks in your window sill it finds somewhere to go so it starts going there into your floor electronics and anything it can get into all because you didnêt have any dirt to absorb the extra water.

The reason why Charleston is flooding so much is because the city has developed-impermeable surfaces which are areas that humans have created with materials that do not allow water to go through like sidewalks, buildings, and roads.  Without all of these objects in the way of the water, Charleston could make more developed-permeable surfaces which is areas that humans have created with materials that allow water to go through like soccer fields covered with grass.",0,3,0,1B 137," The city of Charleston was founded in the early 1990s but grown a lot over time.  During that time they have built new schools and homes, and have expanded roads.  The city of Charleston has been having problems with the city flooding every time it rains really hard.  Flooding has never had a problem until 2005 floods have increased since. The citizens of Charleston are very worried because flooding can be very dangerous and cause damage. A local middle school science class is looking into the problem.  Students collected data about the cities precipitation over the last 50 years and the amount of land used for other purposes.  The land was used to divided into 3 different categories such as: developed _impermeable surfaces, developed-permeable surfaces, and natural areas that humans have created with minerals that wont let water though such as sidewalks, roads, or even building. The changes in the area coverageês in Charleston, in 2013 there was only 45% of natural areas while in 1973 there was 75% of natural areas, and natural lands keep decreasing. The cause of the Charleston flooding is the increase of the precipitation.  So as I said in 2005 is when all the flooding really started to flood, well therefore increased precipitation is the leading cause to local floods. Charlestonês floodingês are due to the increasing in developed land areas with impermeable services.  But yes it will keep flooding if you keep putting sidewalks down and building down to where water canêt go though anything.  The water will just keep building up and building up; the water has to go somewhere so it floods.  When you put something in the way of where water flows though it will get higher and higher until it can get somewhere else. ",,,,B 138,I guess that the water was held back more when the natural areas were more abundant because of roots or something and sidewalks are restricting water flow.,,,,B 139,"I think that the meteorologistês claim The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased is precipitationê is inaccurate because the city is probably full of things that water can go thru. I know the earth is heating up to greenhouse gases trapped in our atmosphere. I think with putting the information together they are both right. The sun is heating up the water, and it is evaporating, then it falls down to the ground and canêt go through the cement, buildings, or sidewalks, and just stays there as long as it evaporates again or it finds a place to go into the ground. The way to fix it is by adding drain holes in or beside the road or slanting to road on each side making the water go down in the drain holes. People should put gutters on the houses and make the water flow into a hole in the ground or in a barrel to save it for watering animals. Another way to fix it is to not put pavement everywhere and only put simple roads where the need to go. They can always try to preserve the water by putting a tarp over a pool or if they have a rain barrel they can put a smaller tarp or a big rag over it. They should also quit building things and let the land be land. ",,,,B 140,"The cause of the increased flooding in Charlestonês not because of increased rain and snowfall. The meteorologistês argument states that the cause of charlestons increased flooding problem Is all the increased rain and snowfall. It has been steadily growing since 2005. The true cause of the increased flooding is being caused by developed land aereas with impermeable surfaces.  It causes the flooding because the impermeable surfaces cannot let water flow through therefore, causing the flooding. In 1973 developed impermeable surfaces were down low and began steadily rising along with the flood rates ever since.  The evedince supports my claim because it shows data rates and the impermeable surfaces rising and the floods started soon after. ",3,3,3,2B 141,"Due to the increases in the developed land with impermeable surfaces the water cannot go though in to the ground like it would regularly. Due to the fact that they built a lot of houses and expanded the roads the water cant go below the surface. The meteorologist claims that it is because the increase in snow and rain fall. The truth is if he would have studied the area and the lands he would have know it is from the ground and not the increase of rain fall. The reason the city is actual flooding is because they built three new schools, built more sidewalks, and parking lot which is impermeable land. In 1973 there were barley any floods or none at all. There were a lot of natural areas so the the water can go though and go below the surface. That increased over the years but it wasnêt until 2003 when more floods stared to happen. Then in 2013 there were more impermeable areas then natural areas. The meteorologist is wrong itês not due to the more rain fall. It is due to the fact that they wanted to build more impermeable areas. The evidence I used supports the claim because I used the research to help support my claim.",,,,B 142,"The meteorologists theory is incorrect because Charleston has had an increased amount of precipitation in the past with out flooding problems. Between 1963 and 1973 Charleston had about 60 inches of rain. There were no reports of flooding during that time. About 75% of the land was covered by natural areas. Roughly 25% of the land was covered by developed impermeable and permeable surfaces was very low. The land should have something to do with flooding problems. If there were more natural areas in 1973 and there were no flooding problems than perhaps the problem is turning natural areas into permeable and impermeable surfaces. More and more developed impermeable surfaces were developed between 2003 and 2013.  This creates the issue that the precipitation has nowhere to go. The precipitation has no other choice but to build up, which causes the area to flood. The permeable surfaces create an issue as well. The permeable surfaces are things like soccer fields. A soccer field would get washed away during increased amounts of precipitation. During a light rain or snowfall the field might hold the precipitation until a heavier rain or snowfall comes along and washes the precipitation along with rest of the precipitation and then it all runs together making it seem like more precipitation came down than what actually did .The precipitation than runs into impermeable surfaces.",2,2,3,1B 143,Charleston flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. There has been a meteorologist that has inaccurate information on why Charleston is flooding. He failed to mention impermeable surfaces. Here are a few reasons on why the meteorologist is incorrect. In this argument the meteorologist said that the flooding has been caused by the land increase on the population of Charleston and also mentioned that the rain and snowfall area have increased steadily since 2005 and he was wrong because the rain has not been a problem because the rain and snowfall has been happening since 2005. Also he said that the building of home and other building has been a problem because he said that the area of the surface has been growing witch brought more rain and snowfall to Charleston. Also he thinks that since they have been expanding the roads its been  bringing more snowfall and more rain witch has been causing flooding.,2,2,3,1B 144,"The meteorologistês claim, is inaccurate because itês not the increased precipitation causing all this flooding, it is because the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. With more impermeable surfaces, the more rain water stored. Say thereês a soccer field, after it rains a while the soccer field is covered in muddy puddles that have flooded the field if there was enough rain to cover most of the field. Or even a baseball/softball field, when it gets flooded. The precipitation has been going up since 2003 but thatês not the main cause of the flooding. And itês my understanding that impermeable surfaces are the reason behind the more and more flooding. The more fields, ditches and other impermeable surfaces, the more flooding. In 2013, 36% of flooding was from impermeable surfaces.  All the flooding is from people making new fields and other things that collect rainwater like ditches, itês not the precipitation. My claim, Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces, is more accurate than the meteorologistês claim. ",4,3,4,4B 145,I think that the city of Charleston was founded in the 1900ês and the water systems were not very good to control water with because the pipes would get mold or rusty and they would shatter so the water would come and cause many floods or because rain would lift the water and it would go over a brick or stone wall  then it cause floods that could wipe out the whole city of Charleston. And a local middle school science class is investigating the data of the cities precipitation over the last 50 years and the amount of rain and snow the city receives each year.  Recently the citizens of Charleston have noticed that each time it rains heavily that it may cause a flood depending on the sea level. It has also expanded existing roads and built more sidewalks and parking lots. But the floods happening in Charleston is because of the rising sea level here and every time it rains the sea level rises then causes more floods to happen and take out buildings and towers.  So if Charleston wants to stop floods just make some type of thing that goes around the city that makes them less frequently and make the pipe systems better so they donêt overflow and explode and flood Charleston. And maybe the data that have have collected over the 10 years isnêt good enough for Charleston maybe they should collect more high tech data that could possibly help out the city and make the floods not destroy everything. Because the technology that we have now is more high tech then what it was 120 years a go. And the Meteorologists are wrong because the floods happened in a more developed impermeable surface it wasnêt a very good place because there was no good things that could stop the flood from tearing everything apart.                                                                                                                  ,,,,B 146,"The meteorologistês claim is void because there was just as much precipitation from 1963-1975 and there wasnêt a flooding problem then like todays.  Change in the landscape due to population growth is a perfectly reasonable answer since water would usually soak into the ground where there is now concrete or fill into a stream that isnêt there anymore.  The graphs also show how much housing has gone up the past few years, and as the prompt claims there wasnêt as bad of a flooding problem before.  So with the rise of housing and flooding growing at the same rate you canêt ignore they must affect each other.  ",3,4,4,0B 147,"The graph shows that the precipitation is rising, since 2013. But the precipitation in 1963 was going down, so this must be man doing in the flooding. The meteorologist examined the data and says Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surface. The meteorologist is wrong. The annual average of precipitation graph just says rain not snow. When man or woman decide to cut down some of the natural areas, the water that the forset uses made some part of the flooding. Even the developed _ permeable sufaces, not allowing water to go threw. ",,,,B 148,"The natural areas for the places to be absorbed and such in nature have gone down tremendously since the year of 1973, in the city of Charleston. People have constructed more and more permeable/impermeable places where water literally canêt get absorbed into, they havenêt had problems before due to the many forest lands because it was natural, the rain water would eventually either be drank, evaporated, supplied plants, or used as bathing supplies for animals, allowing them to clean themselves. According to the water cycle, water is evaporated them condensed into a cloud, precipitated, and then it goes as it pleases. A way we can stop this? We could build aqueducts/water ways to lead the water to a designated area. More populous is coming leading to the need of more shelters for the people.  Citizens should be concerned yes, flooding is an extremely dangerous hazard that often happens. Flooding will most likely happen and it will damage their property and practically destroy everything in sight as that is what flooding does. We need to edit our builds so they can adapt to the weather and such, like making a material that can practically absorb he water, it doesnêt necessarily have to be a sponge substance, it could just be a strong polycarbonate that absorbs liquid and runoff water. The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data shows that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding.  What do I think about this personally? Well I do not live in Charleston so I canêt take in the scene, I donêt even know where It is at so let me take it like thisãitês a sort of suburbs that have 1-2 story buildings, roads everywhere, and sidewalk lining the sides. Cars parked many places, a couple restaurants, and a school here and there. I assume they have little to none wildlife nearby in roughly a 1 mile diameter of the city, there may be the occasional rat/mouse here and there, maybe a squirrel nested in a tree, the regular pet, and some birds. Thatês just the problem, the city is made up of non-absorbent materials meaning the water has no where else to go, its not like its going to go through 5 inches of asphalt, its going to go where it can be drank up/absorbed i.e. a tree or exposed ground. If it has nowhere to go it will force a way to go. Essentially we need to make more natural places, more like artificial forests and such, now thank you for my opinon. ",3,3,0,2B 149,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Charlestonês grounds are impermeable which is causing the grounds to hold more water on top of them, instead of the ground soaking up the water. Beings that the water is staying on top of the ground the water has to go to somewhere so it flows wherever it can go. In the graph it shows that the precipitation amounts have been rising since about 2003. Since the water is staying on top of the ground it has to flow somewhere so that will cause flooding. Even if the water werenêt on top of the ground it would still have to flow somewhere. But because of the water being on top of the ground it is going to flow where ever it can go, which would cause flooding and destroy things such as houses and many other things. The natural land areas soak up the water better than the impermeable land areas and the water that is soaked up is important for the plants. The plants need the water to survive. ",3,4,0,4B 150,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increasing in developments on the natural lands, not the precipitation.  With all of the new buildings and the new schools being built on the natural lands itês taking away all of the water flow areas.  When most of the areas that the water flow was, is being covered its less places for the precipitation to go so it floods the towns. In the early 1900ês the city of Charleston was founded.  When it was first found it was all natural and no impermeable surfaces, but since then it has gotten more and more of schools, houses, other buildings, sidewalks, and roads that were put on the land.  With all of new stuff being built their on the natural lands it is covering and taking away most water parts. When they were building the city they were taking water flows, which allowed water to get through, and they think its just how much rain there is but no. My claim is that with all of the impermeable surfaces it floods really easy.  If they could find a way to allow water to get back through then it wouldnêt flood.  It probably wouldnêt be as natural as it was at first but it would help a lot to open up water flows.  So the meteorologist claim is wrong and you just need to clean up the natural lands and let water through. ",,,,B 151,"Since 1973 the city of Charleston, the natural area of the city has gone down from 75% to 45%, as of 2013. They have built more and more things that do not absorb water like buildings, roads, and sidewalks. Whenever Charleston had more natural land, like forests, they had less flooding than they do now. Thatês because they didnêt have to have as many buildings and roads as they do now. They have larger and more frequent floods because the ground doesnêt absorb as much water because there is not a lot of ground for it to enter it. Yes, the citizens of Charleston should be concerned of the floods because they are very dangerous to a community. It can destroy homes, schools and everything that is in its path. They cause millions of dollars in damage to one community. In conclusion, the citizens of Charleston should be concerned about the bigger and more destructive floods that will come. Most of the floods are caused by less and less natural land that the city has because of all the buildings, roads, and sidewalks.",2,4,0,4B 152,"The meteorologist is right because,  whenever it snows, or it rains in the winter the water goes in the ground and usually freezes but whenever summer comes it heats the ground up and melts the water therefor letting the water seek back into the air which is what lead to more precipitation. Between 1963 and 1975 the precipitation was very high but then it dropped between 1975 and 2004. 2004 is when it kind of leveled out but 2013 it raised the highest within 50 years. The human population is wiping out the natural forest, and have been building housing areas in their places. When they destroy a forest and make a housing area they reduce the percentage of the natural areas left and then they increase the developed-Impermeable areas. Not all the time do they create a Impermeable are though, sometimes they create a permeable area like a park but there are still impermeable things in it like street and sidewalks. And a lot of the precipitation would be because when they make an impermeable area the water gets stuck and cannot go anywhere but up so then when we get a heavy rain and it rains for awhile and the water cant go through the precipitation process. ",,,,B 153,"I feel the meteorologistês claim is incorrect. The increase precipitation is just a minor cause of the flooding. The real cause would be human population growth and the growth of the town of Charleston. The meteorologist said Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding looking at the data given in the graph the precipitation hasnêt really increased by much. If you look at 1963 the town received almost 60 inches of rain/snowfall, by 2003 the town only received 30-36 inches of rainfall. Thatês a huge decrease in precipitation, so that only leads to one conclusion. The flooding is due to the growth of population and impermeable surfaces. In 1973 75% of Charleston was natural areas(wooded areas and such), 12% of the land was developed-permeable surfaces, the other 13% was developed-impermeable surfaces. Now, if you think a bout a town or a city you think of people, houses, buildings, roads and such right? Well in the year 2013 thatês statistically shown. The change isnêt as drastic as most would think for a growing city or town but its still pretty significant. Only 63% of land was now natural area, 17% of land was developed-permeable surfaces and 21% was developed-impermeable surfaces. So the town went from having 13% of its land being impermeable to 21%, whereês all that water supposed to go? The answer is simple, it floods. The flooding problem didnêt start becoming a major issue until around 2005 so clearly the town continued growing, continued losing permeable surfaces and the rain continued to fall. What happens to water when the ground is saturated? It begins to create small puddles, which soon grow, connect and get much larger. Say there is a small creek nearby well that puddle, which is now the size of a small pond, will eventually begin to meet this creek which is rising due to the rainfall. So now not only do you have a creek thatês becoming a river but you have a small pond which started as a puddle, which creates a massive flood. Simply put the increase in precipitation is not the cause of the floods, the increase and growth of the town and impermeable surfaces is to blame.  Look at the town of Charleston as a bucket. At first with nothing in the bucket you can get a full 5 gallons of water in it, this would also be the same concept as having natural and developed permeable land. It wouldnêt hold as much as just permeable land but still it holds quite a bit. Now take that bucket and fill it half way full of cement and let it harden. Then take an empty bucket, fill it full and try to pour it into the bucket with the cement. The outcome isnêt very dry to say the least. The water cant flow in or through the cement so it builds up on top of it until it eventually reaches the top of the bucket where it then flows over and floods the ground around the bucket. Same amount of water, less permeable land and a massive flood.",,,,B 154,"I would say that the problem would actually be what the city builds more than likely but there is always that chance of it being the precipitation I would even say that is mostly the problem. If the city was to make there buildings with a draining side to pass through the building that would help a lot. Yes, there are areas that rain can go through there are more areas that they canêt go through. The high precipitation does not help the matter, but there is nothing you can do to help the actual weather. Charlestonês weather has gotten worse since the 1900. Yes, 2005 is when it started flooding in 2003 there was 21 developed-impermiable surfaces. If you were to put a couple drains in through the sidewalk and in the schools maybe the city wouldnêt flood. I bet the city has had a lot worse flooding since 2003, as the changes in the land area coverage developed-Impermiable surfaces has gotten higher in rates. It was 21 and in 2013 it was 36, so how would you think it would be in 2015? Charleston will keep growing in size, what will you do when it has a over growing population and you have to build more houses and then a flood comes in and it destroys the houses you. Are building you might think there is nothing you could do but there is just put in some drains because you donêt want to have to create any extra work. In the meteorologist argument he said it had to do with the high precipitation but what he left out is the point that you are making solid structures and rain doesnêt have anyway to go through so t just starts to form around the building and gather up. Then there is the point of the natural area and it is perfectly fine it doesnêt have anything to do with this because the rain can pass through this easy.  Even with high precipitations it wouldnêt have much to do with that because then the next town over would be flooded to but we donêt have a problem with the next town you have a problem with your town because you donêt have any way to let the water come through the things you have built around the city. That is my statement. ",4,4,3,4B 155,"Charleston has been doing construction since 2005. And since they did not do a lot of construction before 2005 that may be a result in the flooding they founded this town in 1900 and sine then they have built new school(s), new homes, parking lots, and more. But the flooding there may be a passage that is blocking off the rain, since it cannot drain itself itês blocking it off, yes itês going flood itself. At the first graph in 1973 there is 13% that nothing can go through. Flooding did not take place then. In 1983 it increased to 15% flooding still did not take place. In 2003 it still did not take place it increased to 21% every 10 years it either increased greatly or not very much just a few numbers. In 2013 the flooding had been going on for quite awhile so it then jumped from 21 to 36%.  That was a great increase. The precipitation was great in 1963, but then it went down a good ways in 1963 it was at 55 and then in 1973 it went to 35. The natural areas now which those will be your soccer field grass etc. They started off at 75& then every year it started to decrease slowly. That shows you that the town of Charleston did start to build buildings greatly.  Charleston ended with natural areas at 45%. For the rain to not to flood anymore, theyêll need to basically build another route for the rainwater to exit. If they do that then they will be able not let the town flood as much or anymore. They can try to get it to river etc.  ",,,,B 156,"My argument against the meteorologist is that the annual average of precipitation in this town has not just steadily been going up over the past few years. The chart shows that since 1963 the precipitation this town has received has been varied up and down over the years. Even though they had just as high of precipitation rating in 1963-1973 they didnêt have a big problem with flooding. I think the reason that the town of Charleston is having so many flooding problems is from building to many developed-impermeable surfaces and leaves the water with no other place to go besides build up in ditches, around buildings, and and other developed-impermeable surfaces. In 2003 -2013 the number of impermeable surfaces went up because of the population in the city went up so they had to build more things like sidewalks, roads, houses, and roads. All these things wonêt let water through so it starts building up around them and that when they start flooding around the city. I think the solution to this cities problem would be to put in more surfaces that will let water drain out from the city into rivers, lakes, creeks, or even ponds just so they have some way of draining their water around all of the impermeable surfaces around the city. The city needs to put storm drains in when they build new roads or sidewalks in the town so that when the water runs into the street it will run into the storm drains and not flood the streets so that people canêt drive. Even if they started building more permeable surfaces around the town that water can penetrate, the city would have less flooding because itês somewhere for the water to go an not flood homes, buildings, streets, and other impermeable surfaces.",,,,B 157,"The city of Charleston was founded in the early 1900s, but it has grown a lot over the last 10 years. In that time , the city Measures of precipitation indicate how much rain and snow the city receives. A local middle school science class is investigating the problem.

Natural areas are spaces the have not been developed by humans like forest areas. Developed _impermeable surfaces are areas the humans have created with materials that do not allow water to go through like sidewalks, buildings, and roads. Developed- permeable surfaces are areas that humans have created with materials that allow water to go through like soccer fields covered with grass. The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation.  Recently, the citizens of Charleston have noticed that the city floods each time it rain heavily. The annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005.

The Meteorologist has also said that the increased precipitation is causing most of the flooding problem, but it also has to depend on how many permeable surfaces there is in the area. There has also been floods since 1973 in the natural areas without any buildings there to stop the water flow from moving faster. There has always been more natural areas in Charleston than there is with impermeable surfaces and permeable surfaces.  ",,,,C 159,"Students in Charleston have collected data over 50 years, their information and their data is very actuate. They stated in the second paragraph that their flooding increased in 2005 and has gone up from there; they believe that the reason for this is because of increases in developed land areas (sidewalks, things that water canêt absorb into). They had a meteorologist come in and look at their data. He believes that it is because of the water precipitation that has increased in 2005. I agree with the students from Charleston, they had evidence, flooding had never been a problem for Charleston until about 2005 (they collected data to prove their theory), they had facts such as 1093 they were receiving 50 inches of rain, between 1993-2004 they were at their lowest inches of rain which was 30 and back up to 60 in 2013. Developed land areas are the reason Charlestonês flooding increased. ",3,4,2,2C 160,"The city has been founded ever since the early 1900s, but has grown a lot over the last 10 years. It has over gone construction to man areas such as theyêre school systems and community. Building new sidewalks and roads can help everybody out, is what the people of Charleston said. But because of the high increasing rate of precipitation, a mass floods have damaged homes and schools. When it rains, the water runs down sloped areas. When Charleston decided to rebuild their community and work on roads and sidewalks, they used materials that did not allow the water to soak through and evaporate into the ground. So what happened is all that rain water stayed above ground and started flooding areas with high rain fall percentages. A local middle school is studying to find out the real reason that the Charleston areas stayed flooded. So the decide to bring in a professional meteorologist to explain the reasoning. He states that Charleston is flooding because of the high levels of precipitation. The class still thinks that itês because the new construction isnêt allowing the rainfall to soak through the ground. The real reason that the flooded areas wonêt be tamed is because if there was a lot of rainfall in any other place, it would soak up through the ground. Soccer fields, sidewalks, and even buildings so have water escape routes to drain all the flooded areas.",,,,C 161,"The Charleston flooding problem has been going on since 2005. And has been getting worse over the years. Charleston was founded in the early 1900s and over the last 10 years has grown. But the flood precipitation has grown as well. So the local middle school has been researching this problem over the last 50 years to try and find the amount of the cityês perception.  But meteorologist disagree with the students examinations. The meteorologist thinks that that all the precipitation is causing too much damage to the land and destroying properties. On the other hand the students say that after it is done it grows natural grass and will be developed like forest areas. So everything there on the land will be natural and stronger since it has enough liquid to grow it. But meteorologists say it will damage but it wonêt it just rebuilds land. In 1973 that out of 100 there was 75% of natural area, unlike it is in 2013 where there was only 45% since there was less precipitation. So that means there was less natural areas. And as it is shown in the graph with less precipitation there is less natural land making it develop with impermiable surfaces. So that is why the students are right with their conclusion. And the meteorologists are wrong. Since there would be less natural ground and more unnatural ground. Making it less better fertilizer.    ",,,,C 162,"Scientists believe that the reason Charleston floods so often is because of the amount of rain fall. But I believe that their claim is inaccurate and here are my reasons why: the year 2005 had much less rain fall than previous years, there were more impermeable surfaces in that year, and there were less natural areas for water to soak into the ground. My claim is that the amount of impermeable surfaces caused these floods. The flooding didnêt really start until about the year 2005. Scientists said this is because of the increase in rain fall as opposed to previous years. But thatês comparing the amount of rain fall from years like 2000-2004 when Charleston saw the least amount of rain. But compared to pre 1993, 2005 had much less rain so if the amount of rain caused all of these floodingês then how come there werenêt floods earlier than 2005? Rain fall could not have caused these. My second reason I firmly believe these floods were caused by impermeable surfaces is the fact that in the year 2005 there were much more impermeable surfaces than in previous years and less natural surfaces as well there for it made it harder for the water to soak up. For instance in 2013 Charleston had the most rain fall since 1973 but there were almost as much impermeable surfaces as there were natural so that caused flooding. My third reason for the flooding of Charleston is the lack of natural surfaces. Because of there being a decrease in natural surfaces the water is harder to get rid of so it causes flooding. If there isnêt enough grass to soak up the water the water will just build up and a flood will occur. These are my three reasons on why I believe the scientists claims are inaccurate and the real cause of the Charleston floodingês is the lack of natural surfaces and more impermeable surfaces.",,,,C 163,In Charleston the rate of rain went up majorly in 2005 so that is the reason they have had lots of flooding in 2005. The rain patterns got really high in 1973 and in 2013. And it got really low in 1983 through 2003. There needs to be more permeable land and more natural land.  Instead of impermeable land. Impermeable land is going up faster than permeable land and that is bad real bad. ,,,,C 164,Charleston`s flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces because the developed permeable and impermeable surfaces on the graph the lower those get the higher precipitation will get.

Also the rainfall rapidly increased from 2005-2013.,,,,C 165,"The town of Charleston is a town that has been growing exponentially. Due to this, flooding has been more of a common problem. Charleston students have been trying to find an answer to the recent flooding and made graphs and charts to explain the problem, which a meteorologist explained later that they were wrong. Graph number one shows that the rain in 1970s annually was at around 50 inches and was declining to around 35 inches in 1983.  The rain didnêt start really increasing until 2005 to 2013 where it went from 35 inches all the way back to 60 inches of rain per year. This is vital information because itês not necessarily the rain, but the more impermeable things that were built. Such as roads, sidewalks, or other stuff that doesnêt let rain go through it. Graph number two shows how much water was absorbed or was let into the ground by fields or large areas of grass. With the recent destruction of more permeable objects, it left more space for the rain water to sit on, causing the flooding. More rain didnêt help the cause, but with less permeable things, the rain had nowhere to go. The meteorologist thought the cause of the flooding was by the increase of rain in the past couple of years. The rain didnêt help, but it wasnêt the cause of the flooding. The less permeable objects there were means there is an increase in impermeable objects resulting in more flood water. We know this because back in 1970 when there was the same amount of rain Charleston is having now, there wasnêt a flooding issue. Now with more roads, sidewalks, and parking lots, there is a flooding problem since the water canêt go through it like it could back in the seventies when all of the trees and fields were more common. This is how the meteorologist was wrong.  ",,,,C 166,Charlestonês flooding problem increases because more rain comeês down. The water rise more each year in 1963 50 inches in 1973 it was 58 inches in 1983 it was 35 inches. In 1993 42 inches in 200335 inches in 201360 inches this is the impermeable land percentages ,2,2,0,0C 167,"The town of Charleston has been dealing with a flooding problem that started in 2005 and the floods have only been occurring more frequently. The townês middle school has one of its science classes investigating the problem. They collected their data which included the precipitation patterns in the town from 1963 to 2013, the usage of the land around them, and the changes in land area coverage from 1973 to 2013. The land was either used as developed-impermeable surfaces like roads, developed-permeable surfaces like soccer fields, and natural areas like forest areas. The students also brought in a local meteorologist to examine the data they collected. He made a claim that the cause of the flooding problem is that the precipitation has been increasing steadily since 2005, when the flooding began to become a problem for the town, so the increased precipitation has led to the local flooding. The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem isnêt because of increased flooding, but rather because of the increase in the developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The town is building too many impermeable surfaces and is using the townês natural areas to do this. The town needs a balanced number of natural areas and permeable areas and less of the impermeable areas. The impermeable surfaces are areas that people created that donêt allow water to go through while the permeable surfaces that people made that do let water go through it. In 2003, there were 62 natural areas, 17 permeable surfaces, and 21 impermeable surfaces. In 2013, there were 45 natural areas, 19 permeable areas, and 36 impermeable areas. In 2013, there are only 9 more natural areas than impermeable areas while the gap in 2003 was a difference of 41. The town needs to either get rid of some impermeable areas or build more permeable ones; they need to increase that gap between the natural areas and impermeable areas.The local meteorologistês claim that the increased precipitation has led to the local flooding is inaccurate. Itês inaccurate because in the studentsê data, they had a graph of the precipitation patterns in Charleston from 1963 to 2013. The graph shows that the precipitation in 2005 was 37 inches and the precipitation in 2013 was 59 inches. In 1973, the town had the precipitation amount of 57 inches and had no flooding problems. The graph also shows that in 1990, the town had the precipitation amount of 41 inches. In the past, the town had around the same amount of precipitation as it does today, however, in the past they had more natural areas to soak up the water and to prevent the townês flooding.",4,4,3,4C 168,"The Charleston middle school science class is investigating the problem about local flooding since 2005. They invited a local meteorologist to examine their data. He believes that the main factor to the flooding is relevant to the amount of precipitation they are receiving. Although, I believe that Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces.  The amount of precipitation cannot be the factor as to why the town of Charleston is flooding because the time through 1963-1973 there was just as much precipitation as there was through 2005-2013. So, there was a problem with precipitation a long time before 2005.the way the water system works it always precipitates but then it cycles through and there would be no flooding. So the amount of precipitation is not the reason it floods. Although, Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. With impermeable land surfaces the water would just run on and on because it is not getting soaked up. In the town of Charleston there was a lot of new impermeable surfaces being developed. With new surfaces like that the town would always be flooding because there would nowhere for the water to go. So, that is the reason why the town of Charleston is flooding. Not because of the amount of precipitation. ",3,3,2,4C 169,"The Charleston flooding has increased because the amount of impermeable surfaces as increased. An impermeable surface is when water cannot get through the surface therefore leading it the build of and flood. Due to the increase of impermeable surfaces the water canêt soak through the ground or other surfaces to let the water out. Since the water cannot be released through these surfaces it makes standing water and floods.  In 2013, the amount of precipitation increased to 60inches, while in 2003 it was only at about 35 inches. The local meteorologist was wrong about his argument because the graphs show the year and amount of rain fall in inches, which tells us that the flooding starting increasing in about 1997 not 2005. The other graph we have shows the changes in land coverage in Charleston. This graph tells us that starting in 2003 the impermeable surfaces starting increasing the most. The meteorologist claimed that the amount of flooding accouring was due to the amount of precipitation they had which would make since if the amount of impermeable surfaces didnêt increase as well, but since they did this tells us that the flooding is because Charleston has less permeable surfaces to let water drain.  ",,,,C 170,"The local Middle School did a research project over Charlestonês flooding problem. They found out that they needed to go all the way back to 1963 to figure out why there was flooding problems. They had to ask themselves questions; like, where have they been putting all the impermeable or even permeable surfaces at? Where does all the water go once it rained or snowed? When they were all done a local Meteorologist looked at their work. He said that the flooding was from all the precipitation That Charleston has been getting from 2005. The class thinks that Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The Meteorologist claim was inaccurate. The Meteorologist claim is inaccurate because the Meteorologist went off of the precipitation in 2005-2013. The flooding problem started in about 1997. They started having more floods due to the increase in developed lands. In 1993 to 2013 the natural surface area in Charleston went from 67% to 45% in. While the impermeable Surface area from 1993-2013 went from 18% to 36%. The Meteorologist is inaccurate because the precipitation has nothing to do with the flooding just the increase in developed land did. The Charleston flooding is a huge problem. The middle school project is important to figure out why there having more floods. ",2,2,3,2C 171,"The main reason why there is so much flooding in Charleston is because of how many developed-impermeable surfaces there are. This is the main reason why there is so much flooding. There is so much flooding because there are a lot more places where people do not want the water. This is making the water build up and flood because the water has nowhere to soak in to. But this can be fixed. If they turn some of those impermeable areas in to permeable areas where the water can have some where to sink in to then this may solve their problem. So there is no possible reason for there to be increased precipitation, when the real problem is that there is just too much build up water that has nowhere to go.",,,,C 172,"I believe that the statements made by the meteorologist are inaccurate. He said, The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The climate of an area does not change; they canêt just all of a sudden get more rain each time there is precipitation. The only time this can happen is if a mountain is formed. That can make a difference on weather. But building buildings and making roads cannot change the climate of an area. Like Arizona for example; they donêt get as much rain as Florida, because it is a dry state. They wonêt get two more inches of rain every day if they build a couple buildings, itês not possible. What my claim is on why Charleston is flooding more is that because they built a lot of paved roads. Paved roads do not dispose or drain that much water. Water is holding up and gathering in specific areas where there is no drainage. That is the real reason why they have so much more of a flooding problem. Tomorrow in the desert they wonêt get 4 inches of rain. Climate does not change in an area in just ten years. So this statement by the meteorologist is inaccurate. ",,,,C 173,"Charlestonês thoughts about the flooding problems being due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces are accurate. The meteorologist who claimed that the flooding was due to increased precipitation is inaccurate.  I say this because, flooding was never a problem until about 2005 and while looking at the precipitation graph, I see that around the year of 2005 the annual average precipitation is indeed starting to increase but it looks like it was very high around the years of 1963 and 1973, too. This states that precipitation cannot be the source of the floods because flooding was never a problem until 2005. On behalf of Charlestonês argument, I would agree with it. He says that flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. I would agree with this because around the year of 2005, notice the increase of percentage of developed impermeable surfaces. This obviously has to do something with the flooding, and it makes sense. I know that developed impermeable surfaces are areas that humans have created with materials that do not allow water to go through the sidewalks, buildings, and roads. This leads me to believe that this specific type of land area is causing more floods. If the water is unable to seep through sidewalks and roads, then what does that say? The water will rest atop the surface, therefore causing a flood. With the meteorologistês argument, I can see what he is saying. I get that precipitation can cause flooding but that is not really the cause in this case. If there was never any precipitation and randomly around the year of 2005, there was, I would understand.  So with this, I conclude, that Charlestonês problems with flooding is due to the increase of developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. ",,,,C 174,"The town of Charleston has had many flooding problems the last few years. A local middle school science class wanted to investigate the problem. They said that the flooding was due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. But they got told that they were wrong by the local meteorologist who said that itês a problem because of increased precipitation. But the meteorologist is wrong. The meteorologist is wrong because he said the flooding problem is caused by increased precipitation. Though that may seem correct it some ways, it is not. Increased precipitation could cause some areas of water to be fuller than usual but it canêt cause a flooding. On the data collected by the class it shows that precipitation has rose quite but also that changes in land area for natural areas had also began to lower. On their precipitation graph it shows that between 1973 and 1983 the precipitation began to lower quite quickly and then started to slowly go back up again. On the changes in land Area Coverage in Charleston graph it shows that between 1973 and 1983 the impermeable surfaces had risen. The flooding was also happening during that time so if the precipitation was lowering during those times how would that be causing the flooding? The evidence that I had included supports the claim. The students from the science class all said that the flooding was due to increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. On graph 2 the developed impermeable surfaces had all rise within the years, they had never started going down at a fandom time. On that same graph it also shows that natural areas had because to lowerÄ That has nothing to do with the Precipitation patterns because when it would rain more or less it would never affect the natural areas. That proves that the precipitation patterns have not caused the flooding.  Through my explaining I have explained that the local meteorologist is wrong about the flooding being cause by precipitation patterns.  The students are correct because they did more research and their examples made more sense. ",3,2,4,4C 175,I think the problem was that they have a lot of concrete and the water cannot go down. That is why Charleston floods. If the amount of concrete makes it flood then they should lower the amount of concrete. If they lowered the amount of concrete that would be better. That would stop all those floods.,,,,C 176,"While looking at the graph and the chart Precipitation patterns in Charleston, I could tell that as the years gone by, the annual average precipitation has gone up. While I looked at the Changes in land Area Coverage in Charleston, I noticed that the natural areas went up, but further into the year, the natural areas went down.  Developed-Permeable Surfaces went up and so did the Developed-Impermiable Surfaces. The city of Charleston has been flooding more frequently. How you can by that is if you looked at both of the data they provided you.  With the city of Charleston flooding, it can damage a lot of things. For an example, it can damage, homes, sidewalks that has been built, and possibly it can damage roads as well.  Developed- impermeable surfaces are areas that humans have created with materials that do not allow water to go through. Some examples of developed-impermeable are sidewalks, buildings and roads. Developed-permeable surfaces are areas that humans have created with materials that allow water to go through. Some examples of developed-permeable surfaces are soccer fields covered with grass. Natural areas are spaces that have been developed by humans like forest areas. I do believe that with the amount of precipitation, it has caused the city of Charleston to flood. The city of Charleston has been growing a lot over the last 10 years, but with flooding, it can make the population decrease. A lot of things have been built in the city of Charleston that can be damaged and to rebuild it costs a lot more money than having it damaged. A local middle school class is investigating the problem and they invented a local meteorologist to examine their data. By just looking at the two data the class has provided, you can tell that the city of Charleston has increased the amount of rain and it shows the natural areas are going down because of the flooding.  The city of Charleston has never had a problem with flooding, but that changed around 2005. Since 2005, the floods have increased frequency ever since. Citizens are concerned because flooding can be dangerous and cause property damage. The things that flooding can damage are homes, roads, sidewalks, and many more things. ",,,,C 177,"The data that the students discovered shows that the meteorologistês claim is invalid. As the meteorologist said, the increase in rainfall has caused the flooding, but through time many places around the world have made surfaces like sidewalks, and roads impermeable causing water to run over the surfaces and collect, rather than soaking into the surface itês on, leading to many of the new floods today. One way people can easily prove that the meteorologist is wrong is that the floods recently started in 2005, but before then the amount of rainfall has varied, some years greater and some less, so why didnêt Charlestonês flood any time before 2005? The data that the students showed has proof that humans caused many of the floods to occur, this happened because the people created many new surfaces that are impermeable, causing a drastic change in water level as it rains. Looking at the data myself I could prove the meteorologist wrong, and how the floods started. The data the students collected shows precipitation patterns, and how the land in Charleston has changed. As you may think that more water means a higher chance of flooding, it is sometimes not like that, you have to take into consideration whereês it raining? What surface is the rain landing on? And last of all what were the water levels at before the flood started? There are many things you have to look at before you can give a statement to a group of kids why they are wrong when their data is correct. As you look through the graph that gives the land area coverage in Charleston you can see that over the years natural areas have decreased and that more impermeable surfaces being created. Has anyone wondered where the rain water is going? Or where it is ending up? The water is not just evaporating or flowing into a river; it is washing down these impermeable surfaces and creating a surplus of water that causes the floods. Many people may think that meteorologist are correct every time and have a solution to everything, but sometimes they donêt look at the facts and will eventually prove wrong, as the students proved. As the world is developing, and technology is getting better, people start changing the world, but that caused many problems. The world is limited and if people donêt do anything to help preserve what is left, we are in big trouble. There is only so much space around the world and what will people do when that space is used up? People need to understand what is going on and how many of the problems are being caused. Much of todayês youth can help you find problems and research to find how to make the world better, and how to prevent many floods like the ones that sweep through charleson.",,,,C 178,"The meteorologist says that the reason Charleston has been flooding is because of the increase in population since 2005, The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding.  But this statement is false. This claim is inaccurate because in the years of 1963-1973 they had an increased precipitation pattern but they had no flooding issues. Also in the years 1983 to around 1993 the precipitation kept increasing but they didnêt have any flood issues. Charlestonês precipitation levels have been handled before without major flooding so the precipitation levels are not the cause of the towns flooding. I believe that, Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces.  In 1973 when the precipitation level was about to where it is in 2013, Charleston had 75 natural areas which meant the rain and precipitation could seep through and only 13 developed-impermeable surfaces which was what the precipitation would just sit on until melting/reaching the grass areas to go in. Since around 2005 the changes in land area coverage have been making developed-impermeable surfaces and ever since the increase in these areas it has been causing floods. With these types of surfaces the rain canêt just go in to the ground instead it sits on the roads, sidewalks, etc. and keeps adding up until it starts flooding. This is why I believe that the cause of the flooding in Charleston is because of the developed-impermeable surfaces.",,,,C 179,Looking at the meteorologists conclusion  he says that the increase  of floods  since 2006 is due to increase in precipitation. However it went into the 55 average in 1963 and then it went lower and went under construction built whole bunch of stuff  more areas started to get flooded in graph 1. if you look at graph 2 it went higher in 1973 in natural areas  and it was lower in develop _preamble Surfaces and also in develop-imperabile  surfaces so that means the areas were higher in 1973 then went lower to the year of 2013. That the most flooded areas is the natural areas it only because all of the slopes in areas of the ground of areas and that they did not get in the science class. That reasons were because of the slope areas and all of the construction.,,,,C 180,"The city of Charleston has been flooding more frigidly than it had been over the year. Since 2005 it just keeps increasing. The city gets bigger and bigger more stores streets buildings for people. That means less land there is. Most of the city is not natural areas its developed-impermeable surfaces. A middle school science class decided to do an experiment to see why it was. There data shows that Charleston has gone up and down over and over again from 1963-2013. Also people are using more developed-impermeable surfaces more and more. There is not as much natural areas left anymore its more buildings and stores which are manmade. The developed-permeable surfaces have also increased over the years a little just not as much as the developed-impermeable surfaces have. The class sent there data off to a meteorologist and he said that itês because the precipitation increased, but I believe itês because of all the building that have been built over the years. Builds are made of materials that do not allow rain or perception in over the years there has been more and more buildings but also more floods.  I believe that the increased amount of flooding is because there simply not as much places for the rain to go so it builds up over time and happen more frequently. The meteorologist is stating that thereês more rain there there would be but that doesnêt mean it will flood. The city of Charleston has been flooding more frequently ever year. The middle schools class data showed how the perception patter has grown since 2003. The classes over data showed how sense 1973-2003 that there are less and less natural areas. It is being takin up by Developed-impermeable surfaces.  This means there is less places for the rain to be soaked up at. This is causing the flooding in Charleston.",,,,C 181,"The town of Charleston has been growing a lot lately, like developing natural areas, schools, building, getting more people. But as all of this is happening there has been many floods coming through. Charleston has been getting a lot more precipitation in 2013 than the amount of precipitation in the year of 1973. The citizens are taking this very seriously because it is causing property damage to their houses. This is becoming a problem because the land was split up into three different groups. The groups were Developed- impermeable surfaces, developed- permeable surfaces and natural areas. So there was a group of kids being sent out to study the problem. Meteorologist think that the problem is that the town is getting a lot more precipitation like rain and snow, this all started in 2005 and that is when the flooding started. But what the actual problem is, is because the land is expanding but with impermeable places where the water cannot go through. Flooding is being caused by the water not being able to go through and it staying on the ground to flood the town. This is why the place is flooding because the water has nowhere else to go. It has also expanded existing roads and have built more sidewalks and parking lots. These places are examples of places where the water cannot go through so this is why the town is flooding.  Impermeable surfaces that humans build like sidewalks, buildings, and roads. Meteorologist are wrong because it can rain forever and not flood if there is somewhere for the water to go but since there isnêt anywhere for it to go, that is the problem. Meteorologist are wrong because if it kept raining the water would have a place to go but since it doesnêt the bigger problem is there is nowhere for all the water to go so that is the bigger problem to why it is flooding so much. ",,,,C 182,"Charleston was founded in the early 1900s and up to 2005 hasnêt had flooding problems. But all of a sudden, 2005 was when the flooding began and has increased since. As you know, floods do damage, physically hurting people, physically causing damage to their property, physically hurting animals, and emotionally breaking peopleês hearts. Because, all of their property they worked hard for is just washed away. And thatês why a local middle school wants to dig deep, and find what is causing this.. A local middle school science class is investigating what is causing this flooding, and how they can stop it. The students collected data about the cityês precipitation (snow and rain) over the last 50 years and the amount of land used for different purposes. Land use was divided into three categories, developed-impermeable surfaces, developed-permeable surfaces and natural areas. Developed-impermeable surfaces are areas that humans have created with materials that donêt allow water to go through. Developed-permeable surfaces are areas that humans have created with materials that allow water to go through. The precipitation patterns in charleston",,,,C 183,The meteorologist sand that the precipitation is what cosigns all the flooding. But that is not true it is all the developed-permeable and developed-impermeable that is cosign all the flooding. Like sidewalks the water runs off of it and in to the roads which cases flooding. Another thing is that the soccer fields flood faster because the water haves nowhere to go.   So the meteorologist is wrong because it is all because of developed-permeable and developed-impermeable. ,,,,C 184,"The city of Charleston has had a steady increase of floods since 2005.  Many residents believe the reason for newly floods are because the city has built many new housing developments and sidewalks and these have caused the area to flood easier.  Due to the increase of rain in the Charleston area, some have even believed the flooding is not caused by the newly devolved structures, but the amount of precipitation itself. The residents of Charleston have a new flooding problem which has caused the residents to believe a number of reasons why.  A local meteorologistês reported that, The annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005.  Now, these claims that the meteorologists made are incorrect.  I believe that his claims are wrong because, the amount of rain and snowfall has had a steady increase and decrease since it was first recorded in 1963.  Yes the area has experienced a little more rain but it is not the reason as to why the area is experiencing more flooding.  The area is having floods due to the increase of new building that donêt allow water to not be able to get through.  The graph show that through the years of 1973 and 2013, Charleston has had a total of 103 new impermeable surfaces made in the city of Charleston.  ",,,,C 185,The meteorologist is wrong because the amount of rain has not change over the years. The only thing that has change was the increase in permeable and impermeable surfaces. Because of the increase in those two things is why more flooding is happening more often because there is no were for the water to go. Back in 1973 there was more Natural Areas so water would seep in to the grown.  But now in 2013 there is no were for the rain water to go. That is why there has been an increase of floods over the years.,,,,C 186,"Looking at the meteorologistês conclusion he says that the increase in floods since 2005 is due to an increase in precipitation. However I find this claim to be untrue. Although there has been an increase in precipitation that is not the main reason why Charleston has been seeing an increase in floods. If you look at graph 2 it shows amount of natural areas, developed permeable surfaces, and developed impermeable surfaces from 1973 to 2013. In the graph you see that as the amount of natural areas decrease, the amount of developed permeable surfaces increases. Permeable means that it prevents water or moisture from penetrating it. The fact that there has been an increase in impermeable areas shows that the meteorologists claim is not all true. The recent flooding started happening in 2005 right as the amount of precipitation and impermeable areas started to increase. The reason that the flooding started happening is not because of increased precipitation but because of the fact that the increased precipitation was happening on impermeable , essentially   water proof surfaces causing the rain not to seep into the ground but instead create destructive runoff that accumulated into floods.  My conclusion is that even if there were increased precipitation, if there were less impermeable surfaces in Charleston there would not be a flooding problem. The meteorologist who came to the conclusion failed to take into mind the evidence of impermeable surfaces increasing as shown in graph 2. That is why his statement about increased precipitation is wrong",4,4,4,1C 187,"When you have a city that floods easily you might want to look at how much developed impermeable land that you have used.  In Charleston they have had a flooding problem since 2005. That is when the flooding really started but they were founded in the early 1900s. A local middle school in Charleston had looked at the precipitation patterns in Charleston through 1963-2013 and also looked at the changes in land area coverage in Charleston. The class invited a meteorologist to come and look at their data. The meteorologist said the cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data shows that rain and snow fall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding The local meteorologist argument is wrong because the flooding in Charleston is due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces.  In 2003 they had a lot of natural areas and very little impermeable surfaces but in 2013 the amount of natural areas went down and the amount of impermeable surfaces went up so that could cause flooding because there is not a lot of grass so not all the water would not be absorbed.",,,,C 188,"The Meteorologist states that the amount of precipitation is what is causing the flooding in Charleston just because the amount of precipitation has increased since 2005 which is when the flooding problem started. I disagree though because on the graph it shows that the amount or Permeable surface has increased but, at one time the permeable and Impermeable surfaces were almost tied. Now the Impermeable surface is much higher. The increase in rainfall since 2005 is a factor of the floods but if you look at the graph, you see that in 1973, the rainfall was much, much higher than in 2005. Yet the graph says that the Developed-Permeable Surfaces was lower. Which that doesnêt  add up, If there was more rain and snow fall but less of the area was covered by water how can that be? The inches of precipitation in 1973 was around 55 inches. In 2005 it was around 40 inches. Yet there was more not covered by water areas in 1973. Basically what I am trying to say is that the meteorologist has to be wrong in some way. Therefor It is not the amount of Precipitation that is causing the foods, it is some other cause but not rainfall. ",,,,C 189,"The meteorologistês argument is not quite right. I believe that the change of land in Charleston is the more accurate cause of flooding.  The meteorologist argues, The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data shows that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding.  I do not agree with their argument.  There was high precipitation fall in the past, the amount of permeable surfaces have changed as well as the amount of impermeable surfaces. In the early 1970ês, there was an annual average precipitation of almost 60 inches. It is questionable as to of why there was no worrying of flooding in that time period.  Around that same time there was 75% of natural areas, 12% of developed-permeable surfaces, and 13% of developed-impermeable surfaces. During the next 20 years after 1973 there was a decrease of rainfall and natural areas.  Which I believe is the cause of the flooding.  Since the natural areas of Charleston was most likely permeable land, the decrease of the natural area did not help prevent the flooding.  With the decrease of natural areas, the increase of rainfall and impermeable surfaces, flooding occurred.  It was not just the increase of rainfall that caused flooding. The fact that Charleston was losing land that soaked in the water like a sponge, caused the flood. The excessive rainfall only participated in helping the flood. It was merely the fault of the town Charleston. ",,,,C 190,"Flooding. Itês a big problem in some areas. It could be because of uneven cities. Or the way the land has turned out the way it has. Such as erosion to the soil. Concrete on a hill. Gives water the advantage to flood down. Instead of soaking in the grass. The town Charlestown has a huge flooding problem. Sense people are curious about the way the town handles rainwater they middle school science class took recent data to see if the rain water is increasing. Plus they asked a local meteorologist to examine the data to see what is the cause of the flooding. He said it is due to having more rain. His claim is wrong. Why?  Because his theory isnêt valid. Sure it could have not rained for a while in Charleston. But in the data it showed that it didnêt just stop raining. Rain is evaporated. Rain canêt all be evaporated at once. Sometimes it could still be a liquid or even a solid. So there for not all the water was evaporated or gained more water.  It stated in the data that as Charlestown grew so came more flooding. When building structures like new schools or new parking lots. Those objects are Developed-impermeable surfaces, which mean water canêt go through that material. Asphalt for new parking lots doesnêt let the water soak through the ground. Thatês why there are puddles. And every time it rains that rain water canêt get to the grass or dirt real easy. It might land on the roof or in a parking lot like I mentioned before. Charlestown may have some ways to drain the water like Natural areas. Area or an object made by nature or not man made. Those areas help control some of the water. Thatês why itês important to have trees and grass and everything with nature. Though the water can cause erosion which could wipe away the top soil. This may be closely watched for farming. Developed-permeable surfaces. Objects that we have made can be passive for water like our clothes or paper.  The meaning is Charlestown didnêt gain more rain. The townês buildings and structures make it hard for water to soak. Never by gained rain.",3,3,2,0C 191,I think the meteorologist is wrong because the city natural areas are going down not up that means that the impermeable surfaces are increase the humans are making ore things that water canêt get through such ass sidewalk streets roads and etc. Which means when it rains itês just going keep flooding because the water doesnêt have anywhere to go because. As you know water soaks in to grass and stuff like that. So if there are not enough things the water can soak through its just going just keep sitting on top of everything and keep flooding. Until they move some of the stuff they build. They said they were trying to make room for more people to live. But that is blocking the ways for water to get through the soil to feed the plant and keep it from flooding. Also the impermeable objects increased 15% from the year of 2003 to the year of 2013 and the natural areas decreased 17% from the year of 2003 to the year of 2013. ,2,4,3,4C 192,"Recently I read a statement a meteorologist posted about the flooding problem in Charleston. I disagree with his statement ill show u what he said then I will state my argument. The meteorologists said The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. In that statement he said increased precipitation has led to flooding. Well if you would look at the Changes in land Area Coverage in Charleston map that Charleston is only flooding more because they keep building more impermeable surfaces (areas that humans have created with materials that do not allow water to go through like sidewalks, buildings and roads.) because were building more of those water is flooding more than it ever has in Charleston.   ",,,,C 193,"Meteorologistês argument doesnêt include anything about the 2nd graph and how the areas affect the flooding. By looking at the 2nd graph and comparing it to the 1st graph it seems that the amounts of flooding increases do to the fact of the amount of Developed-Impermeable Surfaces that were made. From 1972 to 2013 the amounts of Developed-Permeable surfaces barely increase, maybe 1 or 2 every 10 years. The Natural areas also decrease but from 2003 to 2013 it goes down by a lot. If Charleston decreased the amounts of Impermeable surfaces and increase the amount of Permeable surfaces the amount of flooding would go down. The meteorologist said the cause of the flood was due to increased amount of precipitation, amount of precipitation wouldnêt really affect the fact of the flood.",,,,C 194,"According to the claim made by the meteorologistês the flooding that started in 2005 is a direct response to the increased precipitation in the area, although that might not be the case.  According to the research done by the class, around the time the flooding began, the developed-permeable surfaces increased. When the Impermeable surfaces begin to increase just so happens to be when the flooding starts. This is likely because the rain cannot be absorbed as easily as it had been able to before.  In nature most things absorb water, be it plant or animal. So when the natural areas in the city started to decline and become instead developed, the water was not absorbed as easily and the floods started to occur. The largest decline in the Natural Areas also happened between 2003 and 2013, 2005 is when the flooding began.  Also, in the graph of precipitation patterns, 2005 did not have the highest precipitation. So, if the flooding was caused by the precipitation, why were there no instances of flooding before that?  Therefore more water is not getting absorbed by the Natural Areas and/or the developed Permeable surfaces. .",,,,C 195,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces.  This is true because there are more areas of land that do not allow water to pass through. The percent of impermeable surfaces in Charleston increased by fifteen between 2003 and 2013. When water cannot pass through the materials on the ground, it just stays there: standing water. The more this happens, the more flooding there will be. The flooding issue was not caused by increased amounts of precipitation, however. The precipitation patterns in Charleston have increased between 2003 and 2013, but this has not been the only time. According to the data, precipitation patterns also increased between 1963 and 1873, and from 1983 and 1993. However, there were no recordings of flooding from those years.  This proves that the amount of precipitation did not cause the sudden increase in flooding. ",,,,C 196,"Examining the graphs I saw that as the Developed-Permeable and Developed-Impermeable surfaces started to gain more in surfaces that the precipitation had went up also. So from seeing this I knew that the change in land was the cause of all the flooding. The precipitation may have added more water to the land but it isnêt the cause of the flooding in Charlestonês. The cityês flooding is not caused by the increased precipitation it was caused by the following. All the land that was added had changed the way the water was flowing to get to drainages. So this caused the flooding problem by adding land and making the land off balance instead of a steady flow to the drainages. This proves that the meteorologist is wrong because he said the cause was the increased precipitation, but it was actually the change in the land that caused the flooding. I suspect that he is wrong and I am correct I that the flooding was caused by the land and not the precipitation. ",,,,C 197,"Since 2005 the city of Charleston has received a bunch of rain and snow fall, this is causing many parts of Charleston to flood. Now since 2005, Charleston has built many homes, buildings, schools, roads, sidewalks, and even parks to fit the needs of its growing population. Things like buildings, sidewalks, and roads are Developed-impermeable surfaces or things that wonêt allow water to go through them; which allows the water to run off and collect somewhere else causing it to flood. From the class data the meteorologist was right on some points but I think his statement was inaccurate because he said that Charleston didnêt have a flooding problem until 2005, but in the students chart it shows that before 2005 somewhere around 1963 to 1973 the precipitation in Charleston was at its highest. In the second chart it shows how the land has changed over the years, by looking at this chart it shows that there has been a decrease in the Natural Areas. ",,,,C 198,"Flooding in Charleston has very little to do with rainfall. All of the flooding is caused by the increases of developed land with impermeable surfaces. The local meteorologistês conclusion is flawed because he only looked at one portion of one set of data. Another reason his conclusion is incorrect is that Charleston wouldêve had a flooding problem in the 1970ês if the flooding was caused by precipitation but it wasnêt. The flooding is due to the increase of developed land with impermeable surfaces. I know this is true because the amount of developed impermeable surfaces has nearly tripled from the 1970ês. It has increased and so has the amount of flooding Charleston has had. If thatês not enough to prove that Charlestonês flooding issues come from the development of land on impermeable surfaces then hereês another reason, Impermeable land is land that water cannot pass through such as buildings and sidewalks but because water canêt go through it just stays there until it is moved or evaporates.The solution to Charlestonês flooding problem is that they need to make impermeable land into permeable land. They could put gardens and other permeable ground throughout the city so water will have a place to go. If Charlestonês residents do that they will have their flooding dilemma fixed.",4,4,4,4C 199,"Examining, the graphs; Precipitation patterns in Charleston, and Changes in land Area Coverage in Charleston. They both show the rainfall that has happened throughout the Charleston area. And from graph number 1 (Precipitation patterns in Charleston (1963-2013) shows the annual average precipitation in inches. The meteorologistês argument stated The annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. That statement/ argument is totally false. That is because, in the graph of The Annual Precipitation Patterns, show that in 1963, the average precipitation was at 52 inches, and gradually decreased until the year of 1983, when the average precipitation started to increase all the way until 1993, when the average precipitation started to decrease again, until 2002,2003. The graph shows in those years that average precipitation was increased before the year of 2005. In 2002,2003 is when the average precipitation started to increase steadily. So, the meteorologistês theory and or argument is wrong. The precipitation in Charleston, is causing flooding due to the all the snowfall and rainfall theyêve been receiving in the area. Flooding has mostly happened land areas with impermeable surfaces, because due to all the rainfall in the area, which has caused the flooding from permeable surfaces carry the water from the flood over to the impermeable surfaces. Making those areas flood. Due to the average precipitation in Charleston since 2003, caused the land to dramatically flood in those areas. Also, in impermeable areas where the rainfall has fallen into the area, making the area flood as well. So therefore, I am correct and the meteorologist is wrong.",2,2,3,1C 200,"Charlestonês flooding is a big problem with little to no answers. How are we to find out the reason behind the flooding? We need to think about our surroundings. When it rains where does it go? We will also need drainage systems placed around the city to help prevent further flooding. One meteorologist claimês that the flooding is because of Charlestonês recent weather change in 2005. Even if Charleston is receiving more rain now than before doesnêt give reason as to why this rain leads to floods. Rain isnêt like hail. It doesnêt sit on the ground, it soaks in. But what happens when the rain runs out of ground to soak into? If rain has no place to go and the small amount of places it can go it canêt get to fast enough then that leads to the area becoming overcome with rain water. Recent research has proven that impermeable surfaces are being added and are replacing the permeable surfaces. When the amount of impermeable surfaces rises and the permeable surfaces do not there is a rather big difference between the two and that difference is the one that is contributing to the flooding problem. The increase in rainfall isnêt the entire problem but when there is increased rainfall there needs to be an increase in permeable surfaces. Here in Charleston itês the opposite. The reason behind the Charleston flooding is the constant increase in rainfall and it not having anywhere to go. Charleston is like cup; if you keep adding water to it itêll eventually overflow and spill out everywhere. But if you are to add holes to the cup then add water the water will pour through the holes and away from the cup. This is what Charleston needs to do: it needs to create escape routes for the rainfall to pour through and get away from the city. Charlestonês flooding is a rather large problem. The reasons behind this problem are the large increase in rainfall and its inability to go anywhere due to the constant rise of impermeable surfaces in Charleston. If nothing is done there could be thousands upon thousands of dollars in damage. Charleston needs a drainage system in order to function appropriately with its surroundings. ",,,,C 201,"The city Charleston was founded in the early 1900ês, but it has grown a lot over the 10 years. In that time, the city has built three new schools and many homes. This city sounds like a wonderful, calm little city that anyone could live in. But, they have a flooding problem; citizens have noticed that the flooding has been increasing over the years. A local middle school from Charleston took the challenge to find out what was happening. They came to a conclusion that the problem was The increased precipitation, and rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. However this isnêt completely accurate. There are factors like the land and population. This makes the researchers inaccurate since they didnêt take the other factors in consideration like the land and the population. Charleston was founded in the 1990s and it has grown quite a lot over the past 10 years. It has started to flood more and more. The city has built three new schools and many homesÄ.It has also expanded existing roads and built more sidewalks and parking lots. All these are impermeable surfaces. Impermeable surfaces are objects that wonêt let liquids go through. When it rains the water has nowhere to settle in so instead, it rises. On the other hand Natural Areas like a soccer field with grass lets water settle down into the ground. These are called permeable surfaces. Impermeable surfaces cause the city to flood. Data shows that overtime Natural areas like the field have decreased and buildings, roads etc. have increased. This is a possible reason for the flooding. Another factor is the population. The population has increased over the past years. People have a strong impact on natural habitats and as a result, we could also be a factor. The article states that The city has built many homes to meet the needs of its growing population.This proves the students research inaccurate and  that there are other factors that could be causing the floods.",,,,C 202,In the reading  about the town is that there was a big problem with stuff flooding when there was new stuff being built there was more stuff starting to flood so they are looking at the areas that are now  flooding compared to what use to flood in the past. The land there Is used for different things. There was not a problem in the town but during the year of 2005 thatês when the problem really started to take effect.  there is a local middle school in the town that is collecting data so that they can try to find out why there is such a  big problem with the flooding in the local area. Students have taken measurements of precipitation so that indicates how much rain and snow that they have had in the area. When the school in the local area did some lab work on the snow and rain fall it said that there has been more rain and more snow so that could play a big role in the concept of the test because if there is more rain and stuff there is a good chance that it could flood depending on how much rain and how much snow it could flood depending on the areas of the town if they are flat or if they are flat or if they have hills and stuff because then the water could run off which could be in lakes ponds and streams . The data in the graph is showing that the natural areas that the percent has went down like the fields and the forest but on the other side of that there is the developed surfaces it has jumped around in the land area coverage but on the precipitation in the earlier years was no problem but at about 2005 or so it really shot up on the chart so there is a problem there they have had more rain and more so then in some of the previse years .and that is wrong it said that it started going  up in the year of 2003 and thatês about the time it started to go up.,,,,C 203,"I think that the floods have been happening because of how the town chose to drain the water. I have hypothesis that if they were to try something different, the water would drain to an area where it will not cause any dangerous situations and or property damage. Also even if they were to try anything different it might not work because of the increased amount of precipitation in the area. It could very well be the town has a good way to drain the water, but because of the increased amount of precipitation, itês not working as good before the increase in 2005.",,,,C 204,"I think that the claims made by the meteorologist are inaccurate and incorrect due to some flaws made by the meteorologist. The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation, the annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. I think that the meteorologist has missed a key point in his claim that would lead him to the right answer in his claim. The key point is that the growth of the city is causing more flooding from covering a wider area. While the precipitation has steadily increased on developed-impermeable surfaces since 2005, developed-permeable surfaces have increased by very little and natural areas have been steadily decreasing. Instead I think that the cause for recent flooding in the city is the growth of the city, the article states that The city was founded in the early 1900s, but it has grown a lot over the last 10 years. In this time the city would have to build a lot more to support the massive growth in population therefore increasing the amount of structures, and decreasing the amount of natural areas. In 2005 this problem began and since then there has been many more structures that have been flooded, and much less natural areas that have been flooded, which would not be possible if the precipitation would increase because the amount of natural areas would not decrease. ",,,,C 205,"The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is not because of the increased amount of precipitation, as the local meteorologist said but because of the fact that there has been a major decrease in natural areas and more an increase on permeable and impermeable surfaces. This is not giving the precipitation anywhere to go because there are few natural areas where the water can be absorbed into the ground.  The city of Charleston will continue to flood if they donêt take away some of the permeable surfaces like buildings and roads/sidewalks  and impermeable surfaces like sports fields and replace them with natural areas so the water can go underground into the soil when it rains when it rains. The meteorologist is wrong because although more precipitation would help in flooding, that if the city of Charleston had many more parks and other natural areas that flooding wouldnêt be much of an issue because the precipitation will be absorbed into the ground and will cause the town to not flood. In conclusion the meteorologist was wrong on his assumption Charleston needs more natural areas and not anymore building and sports fields until this is completed.",,,,C 206,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces the annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding didnêt become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. The local meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because the water needs to soak in the ground and grow the plants and crops. Developed- impermeable surfaces and surfaces that humans have created with materials such as sidewalks, buildings, and roads and the water runs over the concrete and it canêt help the plants. The reason why the meteorologistês claim was wrong.",,,,C 207,"By looking at the graphs I can tell that the precipitation in the area has increased since 2005 when it was noticed that the city was being flooded more often than it had used to. More rain and snow has obviously been occurring more than it used to because things arenêt working as well as they used to. The graphs do show the increase in precipitation over the years and it has been going up steadily. I can also see that areas have developed different surfaces over the time also. Some of the areas are more wet, and some of the areas are more dry it just all depends on where that they are located at. But with all the rain and snow that has been coming all of the areas around might become more permeable. They all might be spots that are holding more water there then what they used to. So to prevent the flooding from always happening so badly there should be better drainage systems put in to solve the problem with the flooding in this town.  It is clear to see that better drainage systems are needed because of the amount of rain and snow that has been increasing.

Yes the precipitation has grown over the years but thatês not the cause of the flooding. They had grown in size by building three new schools, many new houses, sidewalks, and parking lots in years 1995 to 2005 and that would cause flooding because there would nowhere for the water to go. They need somewhere for the water to go and sink into the ground and not just sit on the parking lots, roads, and sidewalks. Towns with more building and less land will always flood more than a town with more land and less buildings. You need more natural areas like grassy and forest areas for the water to go.

They did not know what to do. It had dangerous floods and cause property damage happen. Out of nowhere a middle class of science kids know what the problem is. All the kids collected data about the city over the last 50 years and showed how much it rain and snow and how much damage it did over the years.  ,,,,C 212,"In Charleston, flooding has been a large problem. The flooding has been this big of a problem since 2005. It has always happened, but it became more frequent. A meteorologist was brought in, and they said that The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. While the precipitation amount did increase, it has nothing to do with the increased flooding. The reason for more flooding is the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. First, the meteorologistês statement was wrong. This is proven by the fact that Charleston about the same amount of precipitation in 1963-1978 as it does from 2005-2013, meaning flooding wouldêve been a big problem from 1963-1978, because they had a lot of precipitation. It wasnêt a big problem then, meaning the meteorologist must be incorrect. It would not be possible for the large amount of precipitation to cause problems now if it didnêt in the past, when there was just as much precipitation. The reason for more flooding is the increase in developed land with impermeable surfaces. Next, the cause for the flooding is the increase in developed land with impermeable surfaces. This is true because the amount of developed land with impermeable surfaces has increase a lot more between 2003 and 2013 than it did between 1993 and 2003. In 1993, there were 18 areas of developed land with impermeable surfaces. In 2003, there were 21 areas of developed land with impermeable surfaces, meaning an increase of 3 between 1993 and 2003. In 2013, there were 36 areas of developed land with impermeable surfaces, meaning and increase of 15 between 2003 and 2013, which is 12 larger than the increase between 1993 and 2003. The flooding also became a bigger problem in 2005, which is between 2003 and 2013, meaning it is very likely that the large amount of developed land with impermeable surfaces is a very likely cause for the increase in flooding. It is a plausible explanation because the large amounts of areas with impermeable surfaces get in the way of water, meaning it has to stay on land rather than get to a larger body of water, causing a flood. The reason for more flooding is the increase in developed land with impermeable surfaces. In conclusion, the increase in flooding in Charleston is a large problem. The flooding has been a larger problem since 2005. It always happened, but it started happening more around 2005. A meteorologist said the cause was the increase in precipitation. It had no relevance, however, to the flooding. The reason for the increase in flooding was the increase in areas of developed land with impermeable surfaces. Since the increase in areas of developed land with impermeable surfaces is the reason for the increase in flooding, the people of Charleston should stop building areas of land with impermeable surfaces. The decrease of areas of developed land with impermeable surfaces being built would cause a decrease the increase in the amount of floods happening, meaning it is the solution to the flooding.",,,,C 213,Charlestons flooding problems are mostly caused by  the precipitation each year it goes it starts higher at 1963  then it goes lower than higher at 2013 by inch and bigger most natural areas  in 1973 based by in most natural areas. There are less permeable tan,,,,C 214,"Since 1973, the percentage of natural areas in Charleston has decreased by 30 percent. These areas allow water to naturally flow through them and absorb water that may lead to flooding. Since 1973, the amount of developed-impermiable surfaces has increased 23 percent. These surfaces have been man-made and do not allow water to go through them. Examples of developed-impermiable surfaces are sidewalks, buildings, and roads. Having an almost equal amount of these two areas can result in dangerous flooding each time it rains heavily. When the meteorologist looked at the data collected by a local middle school relating to Charlestonês flooding issue, he claimed that it was caused by the increased precipitation. Although the rain and snow may have increased since 2005, I do not believe that it is the reason there has been intense flooding. The reason that there has been so much flooding in Charleston is due to the increased amount of developed-impermiable surfaces. These surfaces do not allow water to absorb into them and result in water flowing freely throughout the city. This is an current issue because when the population began increasing, people did not think about how adding more roads and sidewalks would effect the environment. ",,,,C 215,"The city of Charleston has never had a flooding problem until 2005 as you can see from the chart but I donêt think the flooding is caused by the amount of precipitation. I think that the flooding is caused by the decrease in natural land areas and developed _ permeable surfaces and the increase in developed _ impermeable surfaces. Even though there has been an increase in rain since 2005, you can see by the Precipitation patterns in Charleston chart that in the 1960ês there was a large amount of precipitation but they didnêt have a flooding problem. I think that is because there was a large amount of natural and permeable areas for the water to absorb into. But with the decrease in the natural and permeable areas and an increase in impermeable areas there isnêt enough natural and permeable land for the water to absorb into. So the extra water ends up flooding the impermeable areas like school and stores. That is why I think there are a higher percentage of floods not because of an increase in rain but a decrease in natural and permeable areas.  ",,,,C 216,The claim says that the rain fall increased in 2005 but flooding wouldnêt have started right away if the precipitation just increased. It would take time for the rain fall to increase enough to flood. I think the real cause is the lack of natural area. Since in the past there was so much was so much forest and natural areas thatês where most of the rain would get stopped and absorbed but shown by graph 2 there is a decrease in permeable areas for the water to go so it is going to the only place there is impermeable areas or cities. Yes the rain increase in rain cause some effect but that wouldnêt be the reason why there is flooding because again the more rain fall would just be absorbed if they still more of the permeable areas. So over the all  meteorologist missed some key research before he made his claim.  ,,,,C 217,The city of Charleston has been having a flooding problem for the past few years.  A middle school class did some research on the flooding and decided that the cause of flooding was because of the increase of developed impermeable surfaces in the area. A meteorologist looked at the studentês data and decided the flooding was because of increased precipitation on the area. The meteorologistês theory that the flooding is caused by increased precipitation is incorrect and the studentês theory that the flooding is caused by impermeable surfaces is correct. The meteorologist is incorrect because there was also a high increase of precipitation in 1963 and there were no floods. There were no floods because at that time there were very few impermeable surfaces stopping the water from going into the ground. The studentês theory is correct because from 2005-2013 there were a lot of impermeable surfaces built. 2005 was also the year the flooding started. The flooding in Charleston is caused by the increase of developed impermeable surfaces in the area. The data proves that the meteorologist was wrong and that a bunch of middle school kids are smarter than them. The meteorologist should rethink their life and possibly apply at McDonalds. In conclusion the studentês theory is correct and the flooding is caused by impermeable surfaces in the area.,4,4,4,4C 218,"The cause of Charlestonês flooding problems are directly associated with the increase in development land areas with impermeable surfaces not the precipitation as the meteorologist claims. In 1963 it precipitated more than in 2005. The thing is, in 2005 it flooded but not in 1963. 1963 had more precipitation than in 2005 so the problem is not the rain. It has to be something else. In 2005, the precipitation increased. It had in the past increased but never flooded. The difference in 2005 is the development of land areas with impermeable surfaces. The reason the development of land areas with impermeable surfaces is the cause of the flooding is there is less places the precipitation can go. Over the years, the percentage of space the rain can go has decreased. In 1973 the permeable surfaces were 75%, but by the year 2013, the percentage was 45%. The cause of Charlestonês flooding is because of the increase in impermeable surfaces, and the decrease in permeable surfaces.",4,4,3,4C 219,"I think that this meteorologist is not right. While the precipitation has been rising, it has nothing to do with the recent floods. I honestly think it has to do with the fact that we are making too many impermeable areas. Since water cannot pass through impermeable objects, it has nowhere to go when it rains. This causes buildup of water which can flood the area. If we had more permeable areas, such as the local soccer fields, there would be less flooding because the water would be able to go into the ground. With the large amounts of buildings and streets in the middle of town the water gathers and floods. Another reason that impermeable surfaces are the cause of the flooding is that before, when there were less buildings and more natural/permeable areas, we had no problem with floods because the water was able to move freely.  If you look at the tables shown, you can see that these problems started to rise when there started to be less natural areas. Before, there were no floods because there were not as much impermeable surfaces, and the water was not stuck in the same spot. The claim the meteorologist made about the precipitation rising being the cause, is false. It is merely a coincidence that there has been more precipitation at the same time as these floods. At the same time, more industrial/urban areas were being built, which meant more impermeable surfaces. More impermeable surfaces means more flooding. My evidence supports this because of basic physics. Water canêt pass through certain things so it sits there, and builds up. History also helps, because when there were less industrial areas and more of a natural setting around the town, this problem was non-existent and we had no problem with flooding. Again, I believe that impermeable surfaces are what caused the flooding in town. The floods started around the same time that we built more and more buildings and roads. When there was more nature in the area the problem wasnêt here because the setting allowed water to pass through into another area. The theory about precipitation being the cause of this is false, and the evidence Iêve shown more than proves that I am correct, and that urban and impermeable areas caused these floods.",,,,C 220,Charlestonês flooding problems from look at the information has been increasing by Developed- impermeable surfaces. I think the material that is used for stopping water from going inside the sidewalks and roads are causing the water to build up on over flow to cause the water of flooding. Also by reading the information the water from the rain is only getting built up inside the grass and the grass can only hold so much water that causes the water to overflow. In the 1900ês Charleston only had barley any buildings sidewalks and more to where in 2005 they built a lot more buildings to where they have token up all the extra grass space for the water to be stored. The flooding also got a little bit worse because one day it would rain then the next it wouldnêt. Meteorologist say the rain and snow problem didnêt become a problem until 2005 that shows it gave it amount of time to build up in the right amount of time.       ,,,,C 221,The town of Charleston has grown a lot since the early 1900s. in its time they have built three new schools and many different homes to meet the growing population. But they have found out over the years that when it rains heavily that it floods most of the streets and causes damage to peopleês properties. Now the kids at the local middle school have decided to do some research about it. The first graph that the students made was about the precipitation patterns in Charleston. The graph shows that in 1963 the rain was a high range of about 52 inches over the years the precipitation has gotten bigger and lower. It got as high as 59 inches by 2013.  The graph number two was about the changes in land area coverage in Charleston. In the natural areas it seemed to get are high as 75 in 1973 and get as low as 45 in 2013. The developed-permeable surfaces got as high as21 in 2013 and as low as 12 in 1973. In the Developed-Impermeable surface it got as high as 36 in 2013 and got as low as 132 in 1973. The cause of the flooding problem has increased the precipitation. The flooding did not become a problem until about 2005.,,,,C 222,"Charlestonês flooding problems isnêt due to the amount of precipitation in Charleston. It is due the lack of very few Permeable surfaces. There is a lot of Impermeable surfaces which wonêt let water go through it just holds all the water which is flooding everything. And because of all the Impermeable surfaces in Charleston, the Natural areas percentage keeps dropping every year. And every year the percentage of Impermeable surfaces keeps increasing which is really bad. The local meteorologist claim is inaccurate because on graph 1 the amount of precipitation starts dropping a lot and the Natural areas percentage kept dropping also. So the amount of precipitation doesnêt matter because it will still keep getting a lot of floods. What the problem actually is, is that their needs to be a lot more Permeable surfaces so water can run through and help prevent having so many floods.",,,,C 223,"In Charleston, flooding was never really a problem, well at least not until 2005. Flooding can be very dangerous for many different reasons. Flooding can cause damage homes, buildings, roads, and even take the lives of people. Students from a local middle school have been collecting data about the cityês precipitation over the last 5 decades. Over time as the city has three different surfaces of ground, the different types of surfaces are: Developed-impermeable surfaces, Developed-permeable surfaces, and Natural areas. Some say that the increased use of developed-impermeable has caused an increase on the flooding, but I would beg to differ. ",,,,C 224,"I believe that the increase in flooding rates is due to the new buildings being built around areas that donêt allow water to pass through it and causing it all to move to areas that do allow water to pass through them. So when the areas that allow water to pass through them over flow then the water starts to back track and go towards areas that donêt allow it to pass and then the water starts to over flow. So the increase in rain and snow fall makes it where the water does not have enough time to evaporate and it just keeps building up more and more till it floods. Which will result in water damage in various propertyês and may even cause death in some areas so yes the meteorologist is wrong the increase is due to more rainfall but the more landscape changes that are made are messing up the land and making it harder for water to travel to safer areas so nothing or anybody gets hurt. So if we stop building water stopping buildings we could save us millions on repair damage and save thousands of lives and make more areas that water can pass through so the water does not build up and over flow then lead to a flood. The more things that we build that wonêt let water pass will increase the flood rate very much and will cost schools, business, and many more places a lot of money so to save money we need to build places that allow water to pass through safely (or just slow down on the building of things for a while). The more water thatês builds up will destroy local nature and kill animals and destroy forests so that means that local animal homes will be gone and they could be forced to go more into the city and hurt people for food and if they die off that will mean less food for us as well. So we need to come together and stop building so many buildings ",,,,C 225,"The meteorologist argument does not make very much sense for multiple reasons. In 1973 Charleston had a little less than sixty inches of rain per year. In 2005 they were averaging a little less than forty inches of rain. So the answer is defiantly not because of an increase in precipitation. The amount of rainfall in 2013 is only about an inch or two high then the amount in 1973. He says flooding did not become a problem since 2005 the reason that is, is because the only had 45% natural areas and in 1973 they had 72% natural areas. Charlestonês whole problem is the amount of Natural areas is decreasing and its Developed-Permeable and Developed-Impermeable areas are increasing. In the year of 1973 Charleston was made up of 75% natural areas, 12% Developed-Permeable and 13% Developed-Impermeable. There large percentage of natural areas does a good job of soaking up all the water because of all the trees. Each year the natural areas go down and the developed areas go up. They keep adding buildings and different things that take out the trees and then the water will eventually have to place to go because obviously the streets will not soak up the water and soccer fields do not do a very good job either. By the time we get to the year 2013 there is 45% natural, 19% permeable and 36% impermeable. So if you add 36 and 19 that gets you 55% developed areas and only 36% natural areas. The rain does increase just a little bit by 2013 but the rain is way down in 2005. Charleston needs to start planting some more trees and stop all the development. ",3,2,4,3C 226,"Charlestonês flooding problems have been increasing and local students have been trying to figure out why. The students have been taking data about the past floods and why they have been increasing. A meteorologist went by one day and argued about the flood reasons. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to a local flooding. The meteorologist said that the reason why the floodingês increases is because of the rain and snowfall. He said that it increased steadily since 2005. The city has developed permeable surfaces. With permeable surface and the students have collected it and seen that the flooding were less damaging with developed permeable surfaces. The flooding happen larger due to the fact the water has been eroding down the dirt and cement throughout the city. The meteorologist was inaccurate, just because a few more drops of water have occurred doesnêt mean that it can raise the water. Eroding lowers the area downward and thatês when the water goes in more towards the spots that haven eroded and makes it seem that there is higher flooding.  ",2,1,2,0C 227,"In the City of Charleston there have been many of floods since 2005. People have been saying that this is all happening because of the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. When you look at the graphs in the passage you can see the precipitation improving over the years. I can disagree with them because in the text it says In time the city has built three new schools, and many homes to meet the needs of its growing population. The city has also built more sidewalks and more parking lots. People in the city say that it raining a lot and the flooding increasing is bad for the city band can create a bunch of property damage. I disagree with the meteorologist because bringing new buildings, sidewalks and parking lots can be a good thing for your city. Schools can help kids learn more and be able to allow more kid to be able to learn what they need to learn, and get the correct education to grow up and do their dream job .Sidewalks can help the city by making the city safer and keeping young kids, teens, and older adults of the road and save them from getting hit and losing their lives. I can also disagree because having more buildings can have water flow through more and not get stopped up. Floods and snow storms arenêt good things but they arenêt that bad.  ",,,,C 228,"The meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because from 1963 to 1976 you were seeing the same amount of precipitation as you are in 2005 to 2013. The floods arenêt occurring because there is more precipitation involved, they are happening because all of the natural land where the water was going is being replaced with manmade objects. In the 2nd Graph there is evidence to support my claim. These floods are not happening because of more annual precipitation. No, itês because the manmade structures took up 30% of the natural land over the past 40 years. With less space for the water to go it will just build up so much a flood begins. The number of Developed Permeable surfaces went up by a total of 7% of the last 40 years, but thatês not as bad as the amount of developed impermeable surfaces. The percentage of developed impermeable surfaces percentage sky rocketed by a percentage of 23% which took away from your natural land where the water built up in the 60ês. This is what is causing your flooding, not more annual precipitation. With more manmade structures in Charleston there is going to be less natural areas. They take away the open space for the water to go to and replace it with roads. Those roads are going to get covered in water from the flood. If Charleston were to get their 30% of natural land back for that water to soak up into the group instead of having standing water on the surface, there would be no standing water which means no floods. If they were to close some of the roads and make them natural areas again then less flooding would occur but, with every town more and more people want to live outside which makes the people have to make more roads and expand the town.",4,3,4,2C 229,"The Charlestonês flooding problems was not due to the Increase in population. The Flooding increased because of the Developed-impermeable surfaces. On graph 1 it can seem like it is because of the population but that is indeed inaccurate. The first graph shows that with each passing year the precipitin increases but what the graph does not show is that with each year the artificial developed land increases as well. On Graph 2 it shows the percentage of each area coverage in Charleston. In the year 1973 the natural land percent was 75% and the developed land was at 12-13%. Now in the year 1993 the percent for the natural land was at 67%. Then the devolved land was at 15-18% already you can see the decrees in natural land and the increase in the developed land in only just a couple years tops. In 2013 the natural land was at the low of 45% the developed land was at the high of 19-36%. So in 1973, 1983,1993,2003,2013 you can see how much the land has changed. The only thing the population changes is how unnatural the land has become. That is the only thing the population has changed. So the metrologies claim was in accurate because he did not take in account what the population did to the land and only the land. Could have the land cause the flooding absolutely but there is no for sure thing that caused the flooding.",,,,C 230,"The Charleston middle school science class has been collecting data concerning the recent rise in the number of floods over the past few years. The students have found that the amount of rain has increased greatly since about 2004 which was near the time the flooding began, but the amount of rain they are receiving now is about the same amount they received in the 1970s when flooding was not an issue. The students also found through their research, that the amount of permeable ground has reduced greatly since 2003, and the amount of impermeable ground has increased greatly. The local meteorologist, who specializes in weather, took a look at their data and presented to the class his theory, that the cause of the floods is because of the increase of precipitation since 2005 and has nothing to do with the changes in permeable and impermeable ground. While I agree with the meteorologist that the increase in rain is a major part of the reason for the floods, I donêt think it is the main problem. As I said before, the data collected by the students has shown that although the amount of precipitation has increases since 2005, it is no higher now than it was in the 1970s when flooding was not an issue, which is why I believe that the increase in rain is not the root of the problem. The other possibility that the students investigated, was the changes in permeable and impermeable ground. The ground that the water could seep into to below the surface (natural areas and developed permeable areas such as sports fields) made up between 82% and 87% of the townês surfaces before 2003. Since the recent growth of the town much more land has been developed, and only 66% of the townês area is permeable material. While that may not sound like a huge difference in numbers, it makes a big difference when talking about where all the extra water of recent years is supposed to go. Whereas before, the water would simply seep into the soil and be soaked up by the plants living there, or eventually make its way through the ground to a lake or river, none of these are an option when the ground is developed and impermeable. There is nowhere for the water to go except through man-made drainage systems, which are not as effective as natural systems. This is why I believe that the root of the problem is not, as the meteorologist suggested, the increase in rainfall, but the increase in developed impermeable land.",3,4,4,4C 231,"Simply observing the data shown in the graph of precipitation, and disregarding the other which shows the changes in land area coverage, the obvious answer would be that the cause of flooding is the increase in precipitation. When reading the data displayed on the second graph, it is shown that the natural areas, of which would allow water to pass through, have decreased substantially. This replacement of natural areas with developed-impermeable surfaces restricts the passing of water through the surface, underground. With more developed-impermeable surfaces covering the land, water has less opportunity to escape to the earth, and is forced to remain above ground. Therefore, the cause of flooding is not the increase in precipitation, but rather the increase in developed-impermeable surfaces within Charleston.  Looking back to a later date displayed on the graphs, 1973 had a very large amount of precipitation, but it was reported that flooding was not a problem until 2005. Why may that be? To compare, 1973 had roughly the same amount of precipitation as around the 2010-2013 period. The difference in these times lies within the percentage of different surfaces covering the land in Charleston. In 1973 the natural areas of land accounted for 75% of the land in Charleston, whereas in 2013 natural land only accounted for 45%. The natural land is considered undeveloped-impermeable surface. This means it is land that people have not used to develop on and it will easily allow water to soak through. While this decrease in ability of the water to disperse underground is a substantial factor, there is another that contributes just as much. In 1973, the percentage of developed-permeable surfaces was at 13%. That means that 13% of the land had been developed by humans and is an area in which water cannot pass through to the ground. This low percentage nearly tripled by 2013, replacing the lost natural areas, and becoming 36% of the land. With this much of the land not allowing water to pass through, it is forced to remain above ground for a longer period. The meteorologist claimed that the problem of local flooding was caused by the increase in precipitation. This claim does not take into effect that, aside from the increase in precipitation, the natural areas which would have allowed for the water to flow through have been greatly replaced by developed areas that do not allow water to pass through. With a similar precipitation amount in 1973 and 2010-2013, flooding was only reported to be at a high starting in 2005. The only difference in these time periods is the percentage of different surfaces in Charleston. Between these times, the amount of natural land has decreased and been replaced by developed-impermeable surfaces. This means that the land on which water was once able to pass through easily has been replaced by land that water is not able to pass through at all. The precipitation could have effect on the flooding, but the main reason is the lack of opportunity for the water to get from above ground to under. ",4,4,4,4C 232,"The Charlestonês flooding problem is due to a large amount of rain. Itês depends on the land and how it is used.  In the last 50 years they have lost more Natural Areas and developed more Permeable Surfaces and Impermeable Surfaces.  With the land changing so much and the land is also shifting and changing all the time. But with the land changing so much it is hard for the water to go into the ground if there isnêt enough space, and well there isnêt enough space anymore or else the town wouldnêt be flooding. The land makes a different because over time the land degrades and movies and changes due to nature. The permeable surface and the impermeable surface are growing bigger and the natural area getting smaller.  It makes it hard for the grown/land to take in water. So when you get a lot of rain the ground doesnêt have anywhere to put it so the land just floods.  ",,,,C 233,"Charleston is having problems with flooding lately. Local students have been worried about this and have made data on the rain fall and the natural land and manmade land.  The students invited a meteorologist the find out why. He said the cause to the flooding is due to the increase in rain. The rain amount has been increasing at Charleston since about 2005. There are thing wrong with this conclusion. The meteorologist did not add curtain details that would make things correct. As we know Charleston population is at an increase. The city is forced to add more buildings, sidewalks, and parking lots. When people make things like this itês called developed-impermeable surface.  This is where human create areas where water cannot go through. The water is forced to sit on top of these surfaces. Eventually the water will build up on these surfaces and cause a flood to happen because the water has no natural surface to sink into so as the rain keeps coming the water builds up on the human made ground causing a flood. The rain on natural ground would sink into the ground and wait to be evaporated. The water cycle would take place with the more natural ground and not cause floods, but since Charleston has an increasing population they are forced to increase their roads and also building to keep up with the population of people and the needs of the people such as schools and roads. The increase of manmade ground is causing more and more flood. The water has nowhere to go. The meteorologist is incorrect because with the rain fall the water cycle would still take place and evaporate the water from the ground. The increase in water is not a big change and they have had no problem before. The manmade land is causing the more flooding.",,,,C 234,I think the problem was that there a lot of concrete and the water canêt go down. That why there a lot of floods.  If it rains a lot than lower the concrete. If they lower the concrete than it might not cause a big flood. If they lowered the concrete it could probably stop the flooding. ,,,,C 235,"In the 2013 year, the Charleston area has gotten more rain than ten years ago in 2003, according to graph #1. The meteorologistês claimed that the cause of the flooding problems was because of the amount of rainfall in the year 2013. But, the actual problem is because of all of the more developed land areas that have impermeable surfaces, meaning water cannot pass through the surface. The meteorologists are kind of right, but, they didnêt think of all the possible reasons for the flooding problem in Charleston. According to the Charlestonês Flooding Problem article, it states that the floods have increased frequency ever since 2005. Their claim is inaccurate because there are more reasons the town is flooding besides the fact there is more precipitation falling. The meteorologists claim is wrong because they didnêt think of the different areas that all of the rain was falling from. In many parts of the Charleston area, there are many impermeable places. According to graph #2, in 2013, there was a 36% of new developed impermeable surfaces. It was almost as high as natural areas in Charleston. The meteorologists claim is wrong because they didnêt think of all the different areas rain was falling from, and what surfaces there is.

After the meteorologist fixed the cityês problem they said that the flooding wasnêt a problem till 2005 for precipitation. Yet I disagree to this statement because due to the precipitation doesnêt mean that Charleston could possibly have bad natural areas to make them the way they were. The flood didnêt start the 2005 but then yet again they could possibly have had bad villages that could hold it but not as much as it could have. In the changes of the land area coverage in Charleston, the highest area was up to 75 with natural areas. The highest of developed-peremeable surfaces was up to 19.

Charleston was founded in the 1900ês and ever since then the population has been growing. It has been increasing so much that they have had to build three new schools and many homes for all the citizens. Now flooding has never been a big problem in Charleston but ever since new buildings have been built the citizens are concerned about damage to their land.  Many students going to school in Charleston and meteorologists have been collecting data on the amount of rainfall and the changes in land coverage. The meteorologists made a concluding statement about Charleston saying, The cause in Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. This statement is inaccurate because Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. It shows in the data given by the students that rainfall in Charleston has not changed much in 1963 the average amount of precipitation was as about 52. In 2013 the amount of precipitation is only a little above that average. It is at only 59. The rainfall has never gotten higher than 59 it has only gotten lower. But when putting new buildings all over your land without checking the surface below could definitely cause flooding. The changes in natural land area coverage have gone down dramatically going from 75% in the year 1973 to 45% by 2013. Over half of the land area is being used by the citizens of Charleston which is why so many areas are flooding because the land is being pushed away and being filled with water by the rain and snowfall. Therefore the meteorologist is inaccurate. Charleston is having flooding problems because of the coverage of their land and not the amount of precipitation they get every year.",,,,C 238,"The City of Charleston has seen an increase in flooding, which started occurring in the year 2005. A middle-school science class has been examining the problem by collecting data of the amount of rainfall occurring each year, and the changes of land coverage in the city. The class called in a meteorologist to examine their data, and the meteorologist presented the argument that the cause of the flooding was due to the increase of precipitation. While the precipitation amounts increased each year starting in 2005, the meteorologistês claim is invalid, as Charlestonês flooding problem is due to the increase of developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The meteorologistês claim is invalid, as there was about the same amount of precipitation in years prior to 2005 as in the years after 2005. In the year 1973, there was about 58 inches of rain. The year 2013 had about 59 inches of rain, which is only an inch more than the year 2013. How can one more inch of rain in the span of a year cause substantial flooding? By destroying natural areas in the city, and replacing the natural areas with materials that do not let allow water to pass through, this can easily happen. In the year 1973, 75 percent of the city was made up of natural areas, while only 13 percent of the city was covered with developed-impermeable surfaces. This means that flooding would not be a problem, as rainfall could easily be absorbed by natural areas and developed-permeable surfaces. However in the year 2013, when flooding was a major issue, only 45 percent of the city was made up of natural areas, while 36 percent of the city was made up of developed-permeable surfaces, and 19 percent of developed-impermeable surface.

A meteorologist says this is caused by the increase in precipitation in the town, but with evidence this statement can be proven to be inaccurate. If you look at the graphs given, they will show that as the precipitation increases the number of developed-impermeable surfaces increases. This shows that since it has been raining a lot in the past few years that the water has nowhere to go because of the type of surfaces it is landing on. In my opinion, the impermeable surfaces that are being built cause the water to not go through/into the ground, so it just sits on top of these surfaces  and floods the newly built roads, sidewalks, and parking lots. These new places that are being built are a cause as why the roads are flooding. The roads, parking lots, and sidewalks that are being built are covering the ground. The ground is one very important place that water needs. When it rains a lot most of the water is absorbed by the ground. Because of the different impermeable surfaces covering the ground, this is not possible. These are a few reasons why the meteorologistês argument was incorrect. ",,,,C 242,"The meteorologists claim has some flaws. He says the flooding is because of the increased rainfall. But thatês not true. The main factor of the floods is the fact that there are more impermeable surfaces. Also it rained a lot in 1963 and it didnêt flood, in 1963 there werenêt as many impermeable surfaces.  The flooding wasnêt an issue until around 2005. That was when more impermeable surfaces were being developed. So the rain gathered on the roads and flooded the town. But when there was more natural land it didnêt flood that much. If there werenêt as many roads flooding wouldnêt be a big problem. In 1963 it rained a lot but didnêt flood. In 1963 there werenêt as many roads, because it had less population. When there was less population it flooded less. So the problem is the population which is causing Charleston to build more roads and buildings. The meteorologists claim had some flaws. He said it was because of the rain, but it was because of the roads. Charleston had to build more roads and buildings because of the population. ",,,,C 243,"The flooding in Charleston is not based on the increase of precipitation, but the increase of concrete and other impermeable surfaces. The rain has shown increases and decreases in rainfall since the city started in the 1900ês but the flooding started in 2005 which is 100 years later with just as much rain. The meteorologist said the issue was more rain but can be disproven because in 1973, the amount of rain was just as much with no flooding. In the beginning of the article, it states that the townês size has increased in the amount of buildings and roads since 2000 to 2005 so that means less forests and grasslands to absorb the water. The solution to this would be to add more drains in flooded areas and try to keep more grass and trees in the area. The issue was not a problem in 1973 but the increasing amount of impermeable surfaces is now so the only logical reason to the flooding in Charleston.",3,3,3,4C 244,"Charlestonês argument states that it has increased the chance of flooding because they are using way to much land mass. It states that they have used over half of the nature to put in homes and other buildings. He is clearly stating that before 2005, they didnêt have to worry about floods but since they have built on to the environment they have increased the chances of floods. One graph 2, over  the years the natural areas have been decreasing, in 1973 the natural areas were at 75%, then in decreased in 1983, then in 1993, then in 2003 it was down to 62% then again it dropped very low in 2013, with a total of 45% natural areas. While the land mass was dropping very low they havenêt reached the point were there would be floods every day but if they keep building on to the mass then they will most likely be at that point. On graph 2, it shows when the land mass is dropping the permeable and impermeable surfaces are increasing every ten years. In 2003, permeable started at 12% and every since, it has worked its way up into 36%. I believe that this information is incorrect, because even though the land mass might be dropping it wouldnêt have anything to do with the rain or precipitation because of the buildings and land mass they have used. In the information he has given us he is saying that there was no problem with flooding there wasnêt anything wrong until 2005. But before that there has been many more problems with precipitation too, but now he is saying that it has change the environment that it really has changed the nature.",2,2,0,0C 245,"I believe that the flooding in Charleston is not caused by the increase of precipitation, but by the increase in in developed land areas with impermeable surface. I believe this because the definition of Impermeable surfaces means; Areas that humans have created with materials that do not allow water to go through. This clearly is one of the first clues as to what causes the flooding of Charleston.  Also when the article talked about the growing of this city, itês noticeable that when the population of the city increased so did the flooding. In my opinion the meteorologistês claim is inaccurate. I strongly disagree with him because, while looking at the first graph, you can see that the average precipitation that happens in Charleston really has no pattern to which, which means that it canêt be predicted. Some years the average precipitation is low and others itês high. Also in the year 1963 the precipitation average was higher than in 2005, when people said that the flooding started. Looking at this closely, you can see that it doesnêt make any sense. Therefore I disagree with the meteorologistês theory. The final thing that helped me figures how the flooding of Charleston was the second graph. In 1973 the percentage of natural areas was at 75% and the Developed-Impermeable surfaces were at 13%. Then I noticed that the graph was going in a pattern, because the natural area percentage was dropping while the Developed _Impermeable was going higher, to me this was clear. I strongly believe that the cause of the flooding in Charleston was not the precipitation average, but the amount of Impermeable surfaces that were developed. Therefore the meteorologist theory is incorrect.  ",3,2,4,2C 246,"The meteorologist claimed that the increase in flooding is caused by an increase in precipitation.  However, this is not an accurate statement.  The flooding problem in Charleston is instead caused by more and more impermeable surfaces being built in the town. The increase in flooding was, despite the meteorologistês claim, not primarily caused by an increase in precipitation in the area.  It may have contributed to making the floods more severe, but still was not the reason behind the increased amount of flooding.  This is backed up by the fact that flooding did not become a problem in the town until 2005, which is, as the meteorologist stated, about the time that precipitation began to rapidly increase.  However, the same graph showing precipitation patterns can also be used to prove that there were also very high amounts of rain and snowfall from around 1965-1970.  This was before there were so many developed impermeable surfaces built in Charleston and there were many more natural areas which would have allowed the high amounts of precipitation to drain and evaporate easily. The correct statement is that Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces.  This is backed up by the fact that there was a significant drop in the number of natural areas between 2003 and 2013, as well as a large increase in the number of impermeable surfaces.  This would indicate that the water would have less area to drain and evaporate, so it would become stagnant and lead to flooding.  Had the numbers of natural areas and developed impermeable surfaces remained the same or not changed so dramatically, the increase in precipitation would not affect the amount or severity of flooding in the area.  Instead, the decrease in the amount of surface area for water to drain and be disposed of caused a large increase in the flooding. The meteorologistês statement is wrong because of the evidence from the graphs, which also prove that the flooding problem was caused by the development of more impermeable surfaces, and the destruction of natural areas.  How this might be fixed is by converting the impermeable areas into permeable ones, or, what could possibly work even better, developing a drainage system and trying to restore some of the natural areas which were destroyed in order to build the areas that are impermeable.",4,4,4,4C 247,"The city of Charleston was founded in the early 1900ês, but since then has grown a lot over the past ten years. From the early 1900ês to the early 2000ês the city has built three new schools, upgraded the roads and sidewalks, and has even built many more homes to meet the needs of its growing population. After doing all this work to improve the city of Charleston the city starts having a lot of floods and the citizens are scared cause flooding is very dangerous and can do a lot of damage. Charleston has never had flooding problems tell 2005 and ever since the floods are becoming more and more commonÄ. This is a problem in the city and we need to figure out what is causing it.  A local meteorologist states that the rain and snow fall in the area as increased steadily since 2005. Therefore, increasing precipitation has led to flooding.   But looking at all the changes in the land areas from 1973-2013 the natural areas have decreased and natural areas are things such as grasses and stuff that water can seep in to and not sit on top. But the impermeable surface has increased and the land those dosents soak up water and therefore the water just sits on top of the land and causes flooding. Itês not the increasing of rain or snow fall itês the changing in the land that is causing flooding.

On graph number two, it explains how natural areas have more coverage than the Developed-permeable surfaces and/or Developed impermeable surfaces. I feel that the reason for this is because when humans Developed impermeable surfaces such as: roads, sidewalks, driveways, cars, buildings, etc. When the Meteorologists claim was made that the annual precipitation was the cause of Charlestonês flooding he was partially right. But for the most part, Humans are the problem. As it once again demonstrates in the Graph, Natural areas have more flooding coverage than populated areas. The meteorologistsê argument was good in a sense that we had no permeable and/or impermeable developments. But he hadnêt looked at the bigger picture. While the increasing precipitation was true it is only an escalating factor aside from the developed land areas. Clearly this Meteorologist is wrong when it comes to explaining this problem. The reason why I say this is because when he went to figure out this problem he shouldnêt have just watched the precipitation. There is more to nature than we want to see. My evidence that is needed is provided in the Graph that shows the land coverage areas. The Developed-permeable surfaces percentages were very low. But the Developed-impermeable surface was a bit higher. But when you step back, clearly, natural areas win the debate. Its not just precipitation, itês our cities, roads and sidewalks that cause flooding.",,,,C 249,"It has come to my attention that Charleston has had a massive increase in flooding. I have noted with approval the fact that the local middle school has gone above and beyond to investigate the issue. I looked at the meteorologist claim and I believe it is not entirely accurate. His claim states that, The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data shows that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. I wish to make my own claim on this. Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. While yes, part of the problem is increased precipitation, it is not the full issue. Since 2003, the amount of developed impermeable objects built has dramatically increased from 21 to 36 in 2013. This means that water cannot pass through these objects and therefore has nowhere to go. Natural areas have also decreased a lot since 2003 from62 to 45 in 2013. Impermeable objects have gone up from 17 in 2003 to 10 in 2013. These are areas water can sit and collect in causing flooding. While yes, precipitation increase is a part of the problem it is not the whole problem. This is the whole reason why Charleston floods based on the data provided by the middle school.",,,,C 250,"In the town of Charleston there have been frequent and large amounts of flooding in the last ten years. This is becoming a problem knowing that many properties and buildings can be affected by this. Students did research and made two graphs. The graphs showed two things.  How much land mass humans were using to their benefit and how rain fall has increased. They then took this data to a meteorologist and had him explain what is going on. He explained that the reason that there was so much flooding was because of the increasing precipitation. He said that rainfall has gone down in the 1900ês and slowly rose back up around 2005. In 2013 there was about 60 inches of rain that year. He said that it was simply just because of the rainfall that had increased Here is where he is wrong. There has to be more than the rainfall increasing to cause the flooding. He also never once used the second graph in his answer. He never explained about the land mass that was used by humans over the years.  Around 2003 there was about 21 percent that was used for buildings roads and other things that could not soak up water.  There was only 17 percent that could soak up water that was also used by humans. And only 62 percent that was natural land. Over these years there was a lot of land was used for human purposes, such as homes, places to work, transportation, and other things. And not very much of this could soak up the rainfall that was occurring there. There are a lot of chemicals that are used in these types of building material.  One of the biggest types of things that they used to build in the 1900ês was coal. This was used in many factories for new inventions. But many of them did not know that this was damaging the atmosphere. We then also used steam to get electricity. Steam makes more clouds, which makes more rain. This is why Charleston has flooding.  There could be many power plants and other factories that use steam. And the growing population isnêt helping.",3,4,4,3C 251,"The reason why Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces is because of the population is increasing and is taking away the natural wildlife. People have been moving in since 1973 and they had a lot of natural areas and few developed- Impermeable surfaces. At the beginning of the changes to the land area coverage in Charleston, 75% of the land was natural area. By 2013 there was only 45% left of natural area and it was 36% developed-impermeable surface. In 1973 Charleston got 55 inches of precipitation. By about 1993 they had about 30 inches of precipitation. The people in the 1970ês did not complain about the 55 inches. The Local meteorologist said that the reason why Charleston is flooding more is because of the increase of precipitation.  The true reason why there has been more flooding is because of the major loss of natural area and the increase of population. There has been an increase of 23% in the population and a decrease of if the natural area of 30%.",,,,C 252,The town of Charleston has been flooding over the past couple of years. Charleston has never really flooded until the year of 2005. Some say that the flooding is because of over precipitation while others say that the flooding is due to having too much permeable ground compared to impermeable ground. A local Meteorologist believes that the recent flooding is due to over precipitation. The graph does show that the amount of precipitation did rise as of 2005. But what he does not tell you is that it the precipitation was high in 1973. But the flooding never happened until 2005 which means that there is no way that the recent flooding is from over precipitation because it didnêt happen in 1973 when the amount of precipitation was also high. The local middle school science class is also investigating on it. But they believe that the recent flooding is from having an over abundant amount of impermeable land. When you have too much impermeable land the land will no longer soak up as much water as it had before. Therefore more water is on the streets and flooding the occurs. The amount of impermeable land increased by 23% within the last 40 years. So the more natural and permeable land that gets taken away leaves less space for the water to absorb into the earth causing flooding. I believe that the Meteorologist is incorrect as to why this flooding is accruing. The amount of precipitation has increased before but there was no flooding. The students however are correct in there thinking. The more people that come to Charleston the more permeable objects are put up making it easier for water to sit above the ground rather than soak into it.  ,,,,C 253,"The constant flooding of Charleston is because; humans have built more roads, buildings, etc. There is also a decrease is natural areas of Charleston, which could also lead to flooding because over the years less water is allowed to fall into the ground instead the water is just sitting there collecting up and eventually flooding the town. The meteorologist is sort of correct the rising precipitation rate is also allowing the city to flood but, it has more to do with the lack of water drainage in the town. According to graph two it shows that over the years of constant development of permeable surfaces and impermeable surfaces that there are less natural areas for the water to drain in the ground therefor more water on the surface which can cause flooding. I think a way that the city can control the flooding is more drainage systems in the towns or making bigger drainage systems in the town.",,,,C 254,"The meteorologistês claim the increase in precipitation (rain and snowfall) in Charleston is the cause for the floods. The cause of the floods is they have built over most of the land and made most of it impermeable. There are many roads, buildings, sidewalks, parking lots, just lots of places covered in concrete or black top. Water cannot pass through those things. The data on natural areas have gone down a lot, while developed impermeable surfaces have grown. Water cannot pass through concrete, black top, etc.  So it builds up and joins with the rain/snowfall and gains more water. If the natural areas were there the water would be soaked up by the soil and wouldnêt build up as much.",,,,C 255,"The people of Charleston have decided that the causes of the cityês floods are due to an increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. On the other hand though, the meteorologist seems to think that the cause is an increase in precipitation. In the graph shown for the meteorologistês claim, it shows that in 2005 the precipitation amount was at one of the cityês lowest amounts 10 years prior and 10 years after. Even though it has steadily increased it still hasnêt necessarily reached the exact same amount as when the graph started in 1963. Also with the graph being the proof for his theory, we still donêt know why exactly it is raining more there. Since he has no real explanation as to why itês raining more his theory cannot be proven completely true. If you look at the studentsê graph it shows you how much the different types of land that have been rained on over time have been affected including the growth of permeable and impermeable surfaces. It also shows that the decreases in Natural Areas have gave way to the increase of Developed-Impermeable Surfaces. The rise in developed surfaces is causing the increase in the cityês flooding.",,,,C 256,Hello my name is Logan im looking at your paper for a assessment. I have some questions for you you are lying about the flooding because there is to much buildings and roads .Thatês why that it tears up the town so much.  I have a another question  you should board your homes so the water would not go through. I have an solution the reason of the flooding is cause all of the rods and buildings thatês why that everything is going away.,0,1,0,1C 257,The city of Charleston was found in the early 1900s. The city has grown a lot over the last ten years.  The city has discovered that every time it rains heavily. The flooding really wasnêt a problem until about 2005. Since then the floods have increased in frequency ever since. Now why is that?A Meteorologist is saying that Charlestonês flooding is due to the increased precipitation.  This is inaccurate.    ,,,,C 258,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces.  The flooding has been occurring since 1963 where the precipitation is around 50 inches.  The data shows that the precipitation did not cause a problem until 2013. The precipitation dropped from 50 inches to 32 inches from 1963 to 1983. From 1993 to 2013 the precipitation rose to 60 inches. The more precipitation, the more flooding there is. The graph doesnêt go into detail about the flooding year of 2005. The opposing claim stated that The flooding problem did not become a problem until 2005. I say that this claim is wrong. There was a problem (according to the chart) in 1963. The precipitation in 1963 was up to 50 inches in precipitation.  ",3,2,2,1C 259,"The citizens of Charleston have noticed that flooding has increased.  Many people are saying that the floods are caused by natural, permeable or impermeable areas. The local meteorologist had said the reason why the land is now flooding is because impermeable surfaces but that conclusion is inaccurate concluding from the data in the graphs. Looking at the graph the impermeable surfaces is very low same with the permeable surfaces but the natural areas is very high but comparing that to the precipitation chart you can see that it has to do with the permeable surface. I believe the high preamble surfaces are causing it to flood. For an example in 2013 the natural area is 45, preamble surface 19, impermeable surface 36 but the precipitation was 60 inches. In 1993 the natural area is 67, preamble surface 15, impermeable surface 18 but the precipitation was about 32 inches. In this case the preamble was higher and you got more floods proving the meteorologist was incorrect it was the permeable surfaces causing it to flood.   ",4,2,3,3C 260,This meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because there was about the same rain fall in 1973 as there was in 2013.  There is much less surfaces for the water to go through than in the early years of this town.  The reason for the flooding is there is much less things for the rain to go through than in recent years.   Therefor the meteorologist is wrong because even though the precipitation has increased there are less places for it to go so there is flooding.  ,,,,C 261,I do not think that the Meteorologists argument is correct. Even though he does provide a good argument he states that Rain and Snow fall did not become an issue until 2005. If you examine the charts there is more natural areas than developed-permeable and impermeable surfaces in Charleston. Another example of how the meteorologist is wrong is the fact that the precipitation patterns in Charleston shows that it was close to 60 inches in 1968. The reason for the flooding in Charleston is not the history of the town but the fact that there are so many Permeable objects in the city that the water and snow basically just sits on top of. If there were not so many permeable objects there wouldnêt be a problem with flooding like there is now. Looking at the charts that the students have made and there are more natural areas than anything else. If we have more Impermeable and natural areas there would not be as much flooding shown in Graph 1. I have been telling you all the reasons for there not to be as many permeable things but what do these words mean. Permeable is something that water and other substances canêt go through. Impermeable means that water and other substances can go through it.,3,1,2,1C 262,A meteorologist thinks the reason for flooding in Charleston is because of the spike in precipitation from the year of 2005 when the floods began to the year of 2013. I believe his argument is incorrect. I think its incorrect because if you look at the year 1973 to the year of 2013 the town starts making a lot of impermeable man made stuff. The stuff such as sidewalks schools roads and new homes. These impermeable man made things are not letting water go anywhere it is just setting there in a puddle and more and more of the rain that comes the bigger the puddle is getting till eventually there is a huge puddle there and its flooding some ones basement or some ones back yard. Once all that is flooded if u donêt get the water out before it floods again then you will have a flood on top of that flood. So itês not about how much it rains somewhere because if u have more permeable things around your town then you do impermeable then the water can escape and not flood your town. Rian has a lot to do with floods but if the water can get away it will. So what it all comes down to is there needs to be more permeable stuff then impermeable stuff.,,,,C 263,"The precipitation in Charleston from 1963 to 2013 has had a very irregular pattern. From 1963 to about 1983 the precipitation decreased rapidly. From 1983 to 1987 is began to rise again. In 1993 to 2003 is slowly rose the participation. From 2003 to 2013 the precipitation again rose rapidly. The change in land area in 1973 was 75% natural areas, 12% developed- permeable surfaces, and 13% was developed- impermeable surfaces. In 1983 72% was natural areas, 13% was developed- permeable surfaces, and 15% was developed- impermeable surfaces. In 1993 67% was natural areas, 15% was developed-permeable surfaces, and 18% was developed- impermeable surfaces. In 2003 62% was natural areas, 17% was developed permeable surfaces, and 21% was developed- impermeable surfaces. In 2013 45% was natural areas, 19% was developed permeable surfaces, and 36% was developed impermeable surfaces. With all the data provided from 1963 to 2013 natural areas of land coverage have decreased. In the same time of land area coverage developed permeable surfaces have slowly increased. Also in the same time period developed impermeable surfaces increased as well. Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces because of water not being able to go through anywhere. With increases in impermeable land areas makes it difficult for water to go anywhere which makes it flood. The local meteorologist was inaccurate because there wasnêt a huge increase of precipitation. The precipitation was all over the place and wasnêt at a constant rainfall per year. Also the precipitation from 2005 has not steadily increased it slowly did then it rapidly increased. Flooding could have occurred from 1963 to 2013 with all the different changes in land area coverage. Therefore the local meteorologist was incorrect. ",,,,C 264,"The meteorologistês claim is that Charlestonês flooding problem is because of the increase of precipitation, but his claim is inaccurate. Charlestonês flooding problem is due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. This is proven with the charts provided by the Charleston middle school studentsê graphs. Yes, the graphs do show that there has been more precipitation in Charleston than ever before, but that doesnêt necessarily mean that is the cause of the flooding. In 1973, the precipitation was almost as high as 2013, and flooding was not a problem at that time. Flooding started being a problem in 2005, which in the middle of when Developed-Impermeable areas were increasing substantially. Also, 1973 was when the ratio of permeable to impermeable was completely off balance, showing an 87% permeable to 13% impermeable. It wasnêt until the mid-2000s when the ratio became more balanced, and it was during this time that flooding became a problem. This information proves that the meteorologistês claim was wrong and that the reason behind the flooding problems in Charleston is because there are not enough permeable surfaces. It is not due to the increase in preciptitation.",,,,C 265,"Flooding is a big problem in places all over the world. In some place it occurs more often and some places it happens not very often at all. Charleston is a town that has flooding a lot. But not as bad as what they are dealing with now. Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Their flooding issues are to the developed land areas impermeable surfaces because people have created sidewalks, roads, and other concrete type things over all the grass they have and that is causing all the water to stand and not seep into the ground like it should. This is causing the water to flow down the concrete and end up somewhere where it has no place to seep into or run off to and is just sitting there. Their flooding problems are not because of the increased precipitation. Although the increased precipitation is causing more water to fall itês the fact that the town has developed impermeable surfaces thatês leaving the water sit and flood the town. The increased precipitation is good most of the time for crops to grow and for the land not to dry out but with the developed impermeable surfaces the water isnêt able to find a grassy spot to soak into the ground to make crops grow and to not let the land dry out. Now itês just sitting on top of sidewalks and everything and causing the town to flood. ",,,,C 266,I think the flooding problem was that they donêt have any draining in the city because they absolutely said that the flooding was not a problem until 2005. The reason is that the forest and dirt population went down really fast when the city was made. The dirt absorbs the water so that we donêt have floods. The trees and other plants also help because they suck up the water. The data says that the water level also rises when it weathers.  ,2,3,0,3C 267,"Reasons why I think that the argument of the local meteorologist are inaccurate is because first off, in the passage it does say that the Charlestonês floods havenêt been a problem until about 2005,but then again it does show on graph 1 that the precipitation pattern was indeed higher around that time than there were developed-impermiable surfaces (which was thought to be another reason for the floods to happen). Second off though, the developed-impermiable surfaces have also increased by a lot (as shown on graph 2) and that the decrease of  natural areas and developed-permeable areas has had some change around those times too. So that should  make some reasons logical why the local meteorologistês argument inaccurate. Plus if I were to give an argument why the floods have increased, it would kind of go like this;  My reasons why that the floods of Charleston have increased are because that the amount of precipitation and developed-impermiable surfaces have both increased in the town.",3,2,4,2C 268,"Over the last ten years Charleston has grown. It has built homes, schools, and jobs around the community. However, recently the townês people of Charleston have noticed that there is a flooding problem every time it rains.

The argument is; The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. However, I claim that Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The local meteorologist has said that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Yes thatês true, but the increase of precipitation would not affect the flooding problem without another obstacle getting in the way. You see precipitation is just H2O mixed with other chemicals that come from the clouds. If precipitation is water it should and would most likely soak into the soil on the ground. Therefore, the increased amount of precipitation is inaccurate because the snow and rain would evaporate or soak up into the soil. My claim states that Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Impermeable surfaces are surfaces made by humans, such as sidewalks or buildings which do not allow water to go through. According to the graphs there has been a huge amount of impermeable surfaces created since 1963.This is that main reason for Charlestonês flooding problem. ",4,4,4,4C 269,"The meteorologistês statement is inaccurate because he stated that the flooding occurred in 2005 and thatês false because in the earlier statement it said that it has been a problem that hasnêt been noticed until 2005.

He also stated that it is because of the rise of precipitation in the area that is also inaccurate the earlier statement claimed that the land used for testing was man made with materials that did not allow water to go through or anything in that sort such as sidewalks, buildings, and even roads. The evidence that his statement is inaccurate is in the graphs the first graph which is for the precipitation patterns in Charleston, shows precipitation dating back to 1963. On the graph starting at that time precipitation was at a 51 and slowly rising then about 1973 started to decrease and then was up and down until about 2004 or 2005. Then 2013 it was at a 60 and rising so the flooding problem was still a problem in the mid 60s to early 70s but wasnêt that big of a problem. The other chart that is for the changes in the area of Charleston the data dates back to only 1973 and in the natural areas in all the years have the highest precipitation the developed impermeable surfaces are the second highest percentage it seems that the natural places was better because with the more man made areas the more it would flood do to poor drainage systems so the thing that the city of Charleston should do is make a new or better drainage system and the percentage of flooding will decrease a lot.",2,1,0,0C 270,"For all I know about the Charleston flooding problem, by reading the article all of the students have more of a clear answer about the flood then the local meteorologists.

When the students made data charts, they had a meteorologists look at each data charts from all the students. The meteorologists argument was that the flood was caused by increased precipitation but the students said it was caused by increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces, which was the true answer to the Charleston flood. So the students data charts were accurate to the cause of the Charleston flood, that flood was one of the worst floods in the history of floods, no doubt about it.

Another reason he is wrong is on the graph you can see where they have more precipitation in certain years and less in some years. Thatês why the meteorologist is wrong. The things that I have for evidence proves the claim is right. I say this because the townês people do need to build more impermeable things so when they do have a lot of precipitation they wonêt have to worry about it going through houses and a lot of other things.

On the other hand the local meteorologists believe that the cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is because of the huge increase in precipitation. However they are incorrect because of things like impermeable and permeable surfaces. The claim of the meteorologistês is inaccurate; Charleston did not flood because of precipitation.  In graph one it shows the precipitation patterns in Charleston.  Between 1963 and 1973 there was an increase in precipitation and it had almost as much precipitation as 2013. Therefore why didnêt it flood between 1963 and 1973 because when it started flooding in 2005 there was less than 40 inches of precipitation but between 1963 and 1973 it was above 50 inches of precipitation? Also in graph 2 it shows the changes in land area coverage in Charleston and it also proves that they are inaccurate.  In 1973 there was the largest percent of precipitation in natural area but then it decreases every year shown on the graph. Permeable surfaces allow water go through them but yet over the years the precipitation in those areas barely increase. Therefore the evidence in the graph shows that they are incorrect. The meteorologists claim that the flooding problem is because of the huge amount of precipitation since 2005, the year the flooding stared and it has flooded ever since then.  On graph one it shows that ever since 2003 the annual average of precipitation has gradually increased; therefore about 2005 the precipitationês slope got even steeper. Also in graph 2 it shows different land coverage in Charleston and the permeable surfaces (the areas that let water go through) have increased in precipitation and the hugest increase was from 2003 to 2013 therefore this shows that the meteorologist claim is correct. ",,,,C 278,A lot of things can be the cause of the floods. The meteorologist statement is not correct because the increased precipitation is not what has been happening to be quite truth full the rain falls has been pretty steady. So I do not think that the precipitation is the reason it is happening but there has been more rain fall in 2013 than in the last ten years. But that shouldnêt mean that there is more floods because itês not just from the rain. The meteorologist are kind of right but they did not think of all the possible reasons of the flooding. All the rain might have a little to do with but not for real. Like they said in the article it might be from all the new editions added to the town and the water cannot flow like it wants to because of all the water that stops it. But it can flow the right way in grass and in the forest but when there is all of these buildings the water cannot do what it wants so it is pushed to compact with the rest of the water and then floods. So the metoligist is wrong and incorrect,,,,C 279,"The city of Charleston has had a problem of flooding since 2005.  They have built on new roads that have been mire in depth of like a valley. The lower the above ground is the more the land is dryer and it absorbs. In the text the evidence states that It has also expanded existing roads and built more sidewalks and parking lots. This states that the way they have expanded Charleston is by going down deeper like into valleys and thatês why main roads have been flooding and sidewalks have been flooding around Charleston. It also makes it harder on people driving because driving in flooded water is not very smart your car can get caught into the stream, your car can get flooded, and also you can have bad accidents that can cause death. The meteorologistês data is in correct because they have not been recording data in the places built in 2005. The data they all have recorded was in the places that have been built a while not places that have been built in 2005. ",,,,C 280,"The Charleston flooding problems are not because of the increased rainfall or the amount of snow. The flooding problems are due to the increases in impermeable land. The impermeable surfaces do not allow water to flow through it. That makes it flood because there is no way for the water to flow through so the water doesnêt just go away. The meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because having more impermeable surfaces makes it hard for the water to go anywhere so it floods. The meteorologist says that the Charleston flooding is because of the increase in rainfall and snow in the past years, but the flooding is because of the impermeable surfaces added to the area. The meteorologist is not correct because the average precipitation in the past years start very high in the 1960ês and they drop between the 1980ês and 2000ês. The Charleston flooding problems are not due to the increase in rain and snow. The flooding is because of the amount of impermeable surfaces added to the area. The meteorologist is incorrect because the average amount of precipitation in the past years start high in the 1960ês but they drop down to a lower amount in the 1980ês and the 2000ês. This evidence shows that the meteorologist was incorrect because the amount of rainfall and snow drops over so many years.  ",,,,C 281,The developed-impermeable and developed-permeable areas are created and made by humans and it causes the natural areas to get more of the flooding. The natural areas have more of a range of surfaces in the environment. In the man-made areas there are way lower amount of different kinds of surfaces the meteorologist said that the flooding is because of the increase in precipitation while that would be something that helps cause more floods thatês not the only reason Charleston is flooding so much. I think since there isnêt as big of a range of surfaces the water would end up on from the precipitation could just flow onto the natural areas. And since there is less natural areas now they could get flooded way easier. If you have a 36 percentage of area the water cannot go through it would flood into the natural area and Developed-permeable area. Thereês 45% of natural area so it would take less water to flood the area.,2,1,3,3C 282,"In 1993 when the construction began on the growing town of Charleston, no one was thinking about major precipitation.  If you look at the precipitation patterns chart for Charleston, you can see that at the beginning of the 1990ês, the annual amount of rain dropped dramatically. So, when the town was being constructed, there was never enough rain for the builders to see that their new town would not be able to properly drain the excess water. In the 1960ês and beginning of the 1970ês Charleston had heavy rainfall but there was never a flood problem in the town. This was because the city didnêt have as much developed-permeable or developed-impermeable land. In 1975, 75% of the townês land was natural, in 2013 that number has dropped by 30%. What has grown in recent years is the amount of developed land. This makes me think that the flooding isnêt due to an increase in precipitation, but rather an increase in population and a flaw in the construction plan. The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased population. The annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding.  When the meteorologist looked at the data collected, he made his claim made on the assumption that nothing had changed in the town besides the rainfall amounts. It probably didnêt occur to him to think about how much the city grew and changed in that time. It even says in his claim that he only looked at the precipitation amounts and the not the city growth. ",,,,D 283,They had wanted to do a lot of experiments on the land. They got some test samples for the meteorologist. The rain to much in the little town causing floods.    ,,,,D 284,"The meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because the roads, buildings, and sidewalks are causing the flood because roads, buildings, and sidewalks will not let water go through. The impermiable percentage in 1973 was 13 percent in 1983 the percent was 15 it was 18 percent in 1993 in 2003 the percentage was 21 in 2013 the percent was 36. The meteorologistês claim was inaccurate because it was not the increase of precipitation it was because the buildings, roads, and sidewalks",,,,D 285,"The meteorologistês argument is false because in 1963 the precipitation was nearly the same as 2013.  In 1973 75% of land area in Charleston was natural areas, and then slowly decreased year by year.  Therefore, since natural areas decreased since 1973, and there is no data to show the percentage of natural area in 1963, I believe that the lack of natural areas led to the city flooding.  Also I believe that the amount of permeable areas had a part in the rash of flooding in Charleston. In 1973 there were 12% developed-permeable areas and 13% developed-impermeable areas.  Since then both areas have grown, especially impermeable areas.  By 2013 there were only 45% of natural areas, 19% of permeable areas, and 36% of impermeable areas. The cause of the Charleston flooding is a combination of a lack of natural areas, and the amount of impermeable areas.  The streets will become a channel with impermeable areas on either side.  When the water hits a permeable area it will flood that area and other areas surrounding it.  If Charleston wants to be rid of these floods they need to create more natural areas and to build more impermeable areas.      ",,,,D 286,"The meteorologistês argument is inaccurate because any town can have increased precipitation and not have flooding accure. The increase of precipitation is not the cause of the flooding. The cause of the flooding is caused by the increase of impermeable surfaces. The development of impermeable surfaces in Charleston is whatês causing flooding because the precipitation has nowhere to go after it has melted which therefore causes flooding. The areas that do not have well developed impermeable surfaces have a place for all the precipitation to go therefore not causing flooding.  I believe that the claim that was provided is correct because Charlestonês flooding problems are not only due to the amount of increased precipitation, but also to the impermeable surfaces made by man. The increased amount of precipitation has nowhere to go after it has rained which is causing all of the rain to stay above ground level. The impermeable surfaces are not able to soak up precipitation like developed-permeable surfaces and natural areas are.",,,,D 287,"It does flood but if it rains heavily and it hadnêt flooded until 2005.  They measure how much rain or snow they get, and the floods have increased in frequency ever since 2005.  They have collected data about cityês over the past 50 years.  ",3,4,4,4D 288,The local meteorologist claims are in accurate because the rise in rainfall each year shouldnêt cause flooding. The increase in Developed-impermeable areas would increase the flooding when it rains hard. The water should be socked up by Natural Areas and Developed-Permeable Surfaces.  If there wasnêt as many Developed-Impermeable Surfaces then there wouldnêt be a flooding problem because there would be more places for the water to go and be absorbed into the ground. Around 1968 the rain fall was just as high and there wasnêt a problem with flooding because there was a lot more of Natural Areas. To solve the problem of flooding they could make more Developed-Permeable Surfaces such a parks and baseball fields for kids to play at. This would make the parents happier and help solve the flooding problem.                                                                                                                            ,4,4,4,4D 289,Well the meteorologist was on the right track.   He didnêt include that there is a rise of Impermeable surfaces so water can build up to cause flooding.  That is why flooding is so recent in Charleston.  ,2,2,0,0D 290,Charlestonês flooding are due to the increase in developed land areas that are impermeable surfaces because yes there is more rain but it wouldnêt be that much of a problem if there were more permeable surfaces for the rain to go through. If there were more permeable surfaces the water wouldnêt just sit there on top of them it would go through it therefore that would stop the flooding. But there is an increase in precipitation but the impermeable surfaces in Charleston has doubled in the past 20 years.,,,,D 291,(no content),,,,D 292,"The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is not the increased precipitation. The meteorologist claim is inaccurate because doing research, I was able to find there is an increased flooding rate because it stated that the town of Charleston has grown allot over the last ten years. There for, the ground surface will automatically change. So with that statement, my claim is accurate.",,,,D 293,"The meteorologistês argument is wrong because he thinks that their flooding problem is because of the increase in precipitation, and the research differs from that. The research shows that the amount of rain fall has increased and decreased over the years but overall has stayed fairly the same. Charlestonês flooding problems is due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Over the years the amount of impermeable surfaces and permeable surfaces has increase and the amount of natural land has decreased. Unfortunately that leaves less land for the precipitation to seep in to leaving more precipitation above ground increasing the flooding in Charleston.",,,,D 294,"The 1st graph showed the precipitation of Charleston a. graph 1, the Precipitation has gone up about 9 inches and then down 28. From then on it only goes up about 2 until 2003 to 2013 the precipitation goes up21 inches. In graph to it shows changes in land area in Charleston from (1963-2013). In 1973 the natural area has gone down by 30% in 40 years. Permeable Surfaces has gone up by 7%. In Impermeable Surfaces the percentage has gone up by23%.",,,,D 295,"The meteorologist is kind of correct as to why the town is seeing so much more flooding in the last ten years, but it is not due to the increase in precipitation. That alone can only prove while the problem is more noticeable. Itês much easier to spot a foot of running water than an inch of it, in the same since at a 15ft distance you can see a braided rope easier than a thin string. The root of Charlestonês problems are more likely coming from the amount of concrete and tamped dirt that has been added. When water and not pass through a given surface it has to run off the top. A reasonable solution to dealing with such great amounts of water would be to increase sewage system sizes in lower areas of the city and have them feed in to a large hole outside the city thus creating a pond, and with expansion as needed a lake can eventually be formed. This solution would actually increase human attraction to the city and the amount of wildlife over time too.",,,,D 296,"The meteorologist claims that the cause of the flooding is the increase in precipitation. This cannot be correct though. Between the years of 1963 and 1973, the amount of precipitation was almost as high as it is in 2013. Thereês only a difference of one to three inches, which isnêt very much. Flooding had never been a problem until 2005. This shows that the increase in precipitation must not be the cause of the flooding.  In 1973 the percentage of Natural areas in Charleston was seventy-five percent. Developed-permeable land was at twelve percent and Developed impermeable land was at thirteen percent. As of 2013 these percentages have changed massively. Natural areas are down to forty-five percent. Natural areas are what soak up the water as it falls. With less natural areas the water is forced to stay on the surface and spread. Developed-permeable surfaces are at nineteen percent. These are the surfaces that allow water to get through, letting them flood. If water can get through any surface than there will be the possibility to flood.     ",3,2,4,0D 297,"Yes, the meteorologist is correct about the precipitation increasing steadily since 2005 but he incorrect on why it has been flooding. Charleston has not been flooding due to increase in precipitation, but instead due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The water cycle includes the precipitation sinking into the ground. Well, with increase in developed impermeable surfaces, which hold water, there is less space for the precipitation to sink into the ground so, therefore it will just gather in places, causing the flooding.  Graph 2 shows proof that the percentage of impermeable surfaces increased a lot just between 2003 and 2013. The percentage of impermeable surfaces increased 15% just in these 10 years. This makes nearly just as many impermeable surfaces as there are natural areas. If all of these impermeable surfaces are holding water, then there will be a lot of water not going anywhere.",,,,D 298,"Charleston has been presented with a problem, flood frequencies have increased drastically over the last several years. Local meteorologists are blaming the flooding on the increase in precipitation in the area, but we believe there is more to it. The precipitation measurement has been this high before, and it did not cause floods. In 1973, the amount of precipitation the city received was very close to what it is today, but the flooding was not near as bad. We believe the recent flooding is due to the decrease in natural areas. In 1973, 75% of the cityês land was natural area, and only 13% of the city was developed-impermeable surfaces. Today however, only 45% of the city is natural areas, and 36% of the city is developed-impermeable surfaces. The amount of land in the city that allows water to pass through it has decreased drastically, and the amount of land that doesnêt allow water to pass through it has increased leading to flooding.",3,3,2,4D 299,"The rain and snow fall have went from really high to really low then shot back up so the results were never steady throughout the years up until the year 2005. It didnêt really matter how much precipitation the town of Charleston got it would always flood.  Before the humans starting building things the floods were not that bad, it seemed the more natural land there was the less flooding. The more humans built things over the years the more Charleston flooded.   ",3,2,0,1D 300,"The cause of Charlestonês flooding problems is not due to an increase in precipitation since 2005. The flooding is caused by the increase of developed impermeable surfaces.  The Precipitation patterns in the Charleston graph show that it has fluctuated all through the years 1963-2013. The meteorologist says that the increase happened in 2005, when it started increasing in about 2000 it looks like. It really took off in what looks to be 2008 and that would be after the flooding started getting worse.  The reason that the increase of flooding is caused by the impermeable surfaces is, because water cannot go through the sidewalks, the roads, or all of these buildings. When Charlestonês population started increasing, the city started adding all of these surfaces. The amount of permeable sources is impermeable sources is less, making water flow out of the city a lot slower. In 2003 there was 62% natural, 17% permeable, and 21% impermeable land coverage. During 2003 the amount of precipitation was starting to increase. In 2013 it was 45% natural, 19% permeable, and 36% impermeable land coverage, during this year precipitation was at almost 60 inches a year. With the rainfall being so high and the amount of permeable or natural barely being higher than impermeable surfaces, the water is going to take more time to drain out of the city, causing the increase in flooding. With all the information given from the graphs and what has been going on is Charleston with expanding, the flooding would prove to be caused by the amount of developed impermeable surfaces.",4,3,4,4D 301,"The annual average precipitation did increase in 2005 but not to dramatic. Flooding wasnêt a problem in 2005 because the precipitation levels didnêt rise too much from 1963-1973. .. the city has built three new schools and many homes to meet the needs of its growing population. It has also expanded existing roads and built more sidewalks and parking lots. Since more developed- impermeable surfaces have been built, the city of Charleston has more floods then before. Yes Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces.",3,2,0,1D 302,I think that they are wrong because the land they use is like a little crater or ditch and it is easier to store water in a hole than on a flat surface. The amount of precipitation doesnêt affect much but how low the land is affects flooding more.,,,,D 303,The surfaces that have been made are impermeable so they would not be able to hold enough water to prevent flooding. The water would then overflow and then go anywhere that the water is led to. The meteorologist was wrong about the claim because the percentage of different surfaces does not effect of how much rain comes down or how much it can hold. I agree with the claim of to much precipitation because if too much rain comes down then the rain can start to build up in different place and then overflow. Not of how much or good a surface is.,,,,D 304,Charlestonês flooding problems I believe to be the cause of developed natural areas and permeable land. While the meteorologist say it due to increased rain fall throughout the years. Research has shown that natural areas are decreasing along with the increasing development of land in the area and the average rainfall has increased but only about as high as it was in 1978 so if this was the cause of the increased flood waters the flood waters of 1978 would be recorded as just as high as in 2013 the only factor that differs the two is that the natural areas have been almost used up and have instead been built onto and decreasing the land that is available to use or absorb the water so it doesnêt end up in the city streets charts show that 55% of the land has been developed and only 45% of the land remains 30% has also been developed within the last 40 years and I believe this to be the cause to Charlestonês increased flooding.,4,4,4,4D 305,The precipitation graph in 1963 was 51 and in 2013 it was 60 every year it adds up. In 1983 it went down to 40. Graph2: In 1973 the percentage was 75 in 1983 it went down 2 in 1993 it went down 4 and it could get lower and lower every year. The most area changes was 1973 the developed permeable surfaces was bad because the lower surfaces u got the worst its going to be. 2003 the lowest they got was 17 and the highest was 62. In 2013 the lowest was 19 and it went up to 36 and it keeps raising up every year it went up to 45 the highest land area was 75% of the land area coverage in Charleston in 2015 it will raise higher and higher developed permeable surfaces was 36 and it was the highest out of all of them. ,3,1,0,0D 306,(no content),,,,D 307,"The meteorologistês claim to the students is true in my opinion. The natural areas that the land had back in 1973, compared to the land in 2013 is much lower. The natural areas kind of soaked up most of the water which makes it so thereês not as much left over water just sitting on the ground. Another thing is the Permeable and the Impermeable surfaces have changed a lot more. For one thing the impermeable surfaces have gone up a lot more, which means thereês not enough room for all the water to flow. Now the permeable surfaces have gone up too but not as much as the impermeable surfaces, which is still not leaving enough room for all of the water to go. So natural areas have gone down. Permeable surfaces have gone up but not by much. Impermeable surfaces have gone up the most. I think the flooding is caused by not enough natural land and not enough permeable surfaces, which all the water has to go somewhere and with nowhere for it to go it just floods everything. ",2,4,0,0D 308,"Charleston has a flooding problem that only started to be a big problem in 2005. A local meteorologist has made the argument to the class that it is because of the increased annual precipitation that Charleston has been having flooding problems.  The annual precipitation from 2003 to 2005 has increased by nine to ten inches but it is no where near the 56 to 59 inches of annual rainfall in the 1970s. The high rate of flooding in 2005 is more likely caused by the increase in Impermeable and permeable areas and the decrease in natural areas. From 1993 to 2013 there is a spike in the amount of permeable and impermeable and a decline in the amount of untouched natural areas. From 1993 to 2013 there is a jump from 15% permeable surfaces to 19%, there is also a jump from 18% impermeable to 36% following this increase in none-natural areas the natural areas are declining from a 67% in 1993 to a 45% in 2013. With all the information presented it is more probable that the main cause of the flooding is the increase in permeable and impermeable areas that are causing the flooding",,,,D 309,"Charletonês flooding problem is because of an increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. As the land rises along and around the city, whenever it rains the water gets rushed down flooding the city. Precipitation has nothing to do with this as they said in the passage. Precipitation is the result after the city floods and after it rains so it couldnêt be the cause of the cityês flooding problems. The town is probably just at the bottom of a hill and all the rain water rushes into the town when it falls to the ground. ",,,,D 310,The reason is the precipitation is going up is because the humans have been making Developed- Permeable Surfaces and Developed-Impermiable Surfaces is going up and that is why the precipitation is going up since the we keep making things man made then it changes things and makes more precipitation. The meteorologist`s argument is inaccurate because the precipitation is not only the reason why there is flooding it is also because of the new things that humans keep making and making the precipitation go up.,,,,D 311,The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is not the increase of precipitation. The flooding problem is has increased since 2005 because the Natural Areas have decreased and the Developed-Impermeable Surfaces has increased.  With the Natural Areas decreasing there is less places for the water to go in the forest so the water has to go somewhere so it goes in the city of Charleston making it flood.  With the Impermeable Surfaces increasing from 21% to 36% and the Natural Areas decreasing from 62% to 45% the area that the water can go decreases.   With more sidewalks and buildings being built it takes more space from the Natural Areas where the water normally goes.  ,2,2,0,2D 312,"The precipitation graph shows that floods are not caused by rain amounts, because in 1973 it was higher than 2005. The amount during 2005 was around 35 in. Then during 1973 it was around 55 in. that show that the precipitation had nothing to with the flood. The land area graph show that the natural areas goês down by a lot from 1973 to 2013. The permeable surfaces go up very little and so do the impermeable surfaces. There for the cause of the flood in my calculation is caused by changes in the land area coverage. The meteorologistês claim is in accurate because the jump down from 1973 and 2005 in precipitation changes. So there claim is wrong telling us that it is caused by land change. The land change is a big one because it goes down causing the water to flow in to the streets and causing damage to buildings. ",,,,D 313,The meteorologist is wrong because the rain and snowfall has increased in the last few years. But has not produced more snow it has been a rainier climate time. The rainfall has increased up to at least 20% in the last few years. The rain and snow has also covered more area in the last few years.  I believe by looking at the chart that the precipitating has defiantly increased from 1963 to 2013. And the land that used to not get as much rain and snow get a lot more in those areas. ,,,,D 314,"The reason why Charleston is have flooding problems it that your developed-Impermiable Surfaces is down to low so all of your doors on your buildings will fill up from not being tall enough to go hold water against so your buildings doesnêt wash away. another  reason why your flood charts are up is because of your sidewalks where everyone walks up and down at of a day and the most reasonable way for you to keep floods out it too make your sidewalks taller and away from houses and other marked buildings so your stores donêt throw all of their groceries away. So from my experience with water ways I have for out that if the same spot continues to flood every year, I would either make things taller and more closed in to keep water from coming in. or even sand bag around your city of Charlestonês so water on streets and roads wonêt continue to flow straight on threw main streets or sidewalks. Or to put flood doors on your house so that water cannot go in from the doors to flood your home. But the one biggest reasons I see wrong about the graphs is that the annual percent of rain is going up. but the years are going down.",2,1,0,1D 315,I do think that the meteorologist is right about it raining more but I also think he is wrong with the way that he trying to explain his theory about the reasoning on flooding in Charleston.  The precipitation patterns in Charleston start to drop around 1973-1983 but it starts to go back up around 2003-2013 very fast. So I see why he might make the assessment of think that it is the rain that is making it flood a lot more but there are other things that you have to understand. You have to also look at the surroundings as well and see where and why it flooding more in one area then another. There are very little flooding in areas that human deal with but in natural area that people do not deal with most it has more flooding because of nature itês just the natural process. The areas that humans deal with we can make adjustment to make it were we have as little flooding as possible like making ditches or making it go a different direction.  ,2,1,2,0D 316,"The town of Charleston is having flooding problems due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces.

Since they have built more house and streets, the town has  been getting more and more flooding with not a lot of increase in precipitation. So I have a reason to believe that the flooding is do , to the development of new homes and streets, and not because of more precipitation.",3,2,4,1D 317,"The meteorologist is incorrect because even if the precipitation increases the water should have somewhere to go like a ditch, but there are more buildings, roads, and sidewalks which stops the water. The water gets held in the city so it floods, and the more water that gets trapped there is going to be a bigger flood. If the city were to get rid of some of the sidewalks or roads there wouldnêt be as many floods. With the developed-permeable areas water is allowed to pass through but it has nowhere to go so if the city were to add some drains the water would drain and the flood would be stopped.

The impermeable surfaces donêt allow water to go through, so since the water canêt go through the impermeable surfaces, it just floods. The things that have permeable surfaces such as grass on soccer fields, can have water go through it. So, it would not be flooded there.  The developed land areas that have the impermeable surfaces are the reason it is flooded.  The sun takes up the water and when it gets enough water, rainclouds form and it starts raining. The permeable surface soak up the rain and the impermeable surface do not soak it up at all. That is the cause of flooding.

The annual precipitation data and changes in land area coverage data show an increased amount of precipitation and construction of impermeable surfaces.

All this water has to have a place to go such as streams and fields, but with all the impermeable surface around the water will have to place to go and will flood.",3,2,0,2D 320,Most water systems may help stop flooding in the developed areas.  Damns are a big help and use to electricity. They could build street pipe lines were the water would drain down under the street and go to a cityês water treatment.  The flooding was caused by the developed areas because of precipitation but the city could make a decision to what I stated in the seconded sentence.  ,,,,D 321,The local meteorologist's claim is inaccurate because even though the city has developed more impermeable surfaces there are still plenty of permeable surfaces.  So when they city receives rain or a large amount of precipitation the water should still run off in to the ground that can soak up to water and not cause so much flooding.  Also the permeable surfaces still flood when they receives a large amount of precipitation.   In the year 1973 the permeable surfaces and the impermeable surfaces had about the same amount of flooding.,2,3,2,0D 322,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. In the meteorologist the class put Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. In the classes graph it shows that in 1963-1973 was high as the one in 2005. So the flooding couldnêt have just started. If the data shows the same or close to the same precipitation then why would flooding just now started. Yes in about 2010 it was high but in 2005 to about 2008 they were the same or lower. All the data shows that the precipitation only got worse near 2013. How could the flooding get worse since it is the same precipitation as before. When the year got close to 2013 then it rained more but near or around 2005 is the same as 1963. The time that it should havenêt flooded is 1983 to about 2005. Therefore the meteorologist should have said that the flooding was or close to the same a 1963. Also in 2005 the precipitation was about 38%. But the precipitation in 1963 was 50% and in 2013 was 60%. So the meteorologist is wrong.    ",,,,D 323,"The meteorologistês argument is inaccurate because of where the precipitation is going. He is accurate that the precipitation has increased, but no that that is why it has been flooding. It has been flooding more and more because while the town is expanding , it is taking away more and more of the natural areas, which is where the rain usually went. As the town keeps expanding, there is less natural space for the water to go, so there for it has no choice but to flood it. Sooner or later, the town will be completely flooded, because it keeps expanding, and taking away places for the precipitation to go. Since the town started expanding around the same time the town started flooding, they should have got a hint that the natural areas were being overtaken, and to do something about it. If they were to stop expanding, the town would not flood any more than it has, and if they were to make the town smaller, there would be less flooding.",4,3,3,4E 324,"The meteorologistês claim that Charlestonês flooding problem is inaccurate because not only is Charlestonês annual average precipitation increased largely since the 1980ês, Charlestonês amount of developed-permeable surfaces has raised plenty. While the amount natural areas have lowered. This information is proven by the charts a local middle school science class made by investigating the problem and collecting important data. The meteorologist failed to really pay much attention to the changes in land coverage in Charleston, the meteorologist went directly to what he knew best weather and weather patterns and without the land coverage data made a conclusion without all the facts. There is the argument that the amount of developed-impermeable surfaces in Charleston has also raised, but the amount of developed-impermeable surfaces have not raised as much as developed-permeable surfaces have .Therefore I conclude that the reason Charleston is having frequent floods is because of a lack of developed-impermeable surfaces and too many permeable surfaces, also something to note there has there a large drop in natural areas in Charleston. For the meteorologists to fix his mistake he should read all the data first before concluding his claim on Charlestonês flooding problem. ",,,,E 325,"I believe that the claim, Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces, is accurate because, on the graph it shows that as the developed impermeable surfaces grow the annual precipitation grows. The meteorologistês claim is false because there is more land to be effected the precipitation, and less natural areas. So because there is an increase in developed impermeable surfaces there is going to be more area effected which leads to floods. The meteorologistês statement is also false because there is not a lot of information to back up his claim. Also just because there is an increase in the rain you have to factor in that there is more developed impermeable surfaces, which in his claim there is no sign of the meteorologistês factoring in. Also to further back up my claim around 2005 the developed impermeable surfaces started to increase at the same time the annual average precipitation (inch) started to grow. So this leaves me to the conclusion that the cause of the floods are because the increase of the developed impermeable surfaces.",3,2,4,3E 326,"The problem of Charleston happened because there rained a lot, and probably there wasnêt enough money to investigate more about the problem. The people were not able to handle that, and maybe the people thought that the problem was going to end early, but when the time past the flooding problem increased! For the citizens of Charleston this was obviously not going to be good news. Charlestonês population was increasing because of the schools and homes but the flooding problem was increasing too, which made the Charlestonês citizens to start to worry because their houses started to get damage.",,,,E 327,"The town of Charleston has had a lot of flooding since 2005. Some people believe it is do the raise in precipitation. Others believe it is due to the recent land improvements like a new soccer field, more streets and other land structures that canêt absorb water as well as before. A local meteorologistês opinion was how the precipitation has increased but in 1963 it had rained over 50 inches and there was no report of flooding. In 2013 with all the new improvements it has rained about 60 inches and there was flooding. The meteorologist claimed that the floods had nothing to do with the new land improvements. Though that isnêt fair to say, because it has not yet been tested to see if the roads and other areas that canêt absorb water after the rain around the town have built up near peopleês houses.  A group of students have collected data throughout the last 50 years and found out that in 2013 there were 45% of natural areas, 19% of developed permeable surfaces, and 36% developed impermeable surfaces left. In 1973 there were 75% natural areas, 12% of developed permeable surfaces, and 13% developed impermeable surfaces. So there has been lots of change here so we cannot say the ten inches of more rain is the only thing that has changed. The meteorologistês opinion has also claimed that the town has not had this much rain before. The town has had rain very, very, close to 60 inches before. Over the last 50 years the closest the rain has gotten is about 58 inches. So the meteorologist has to see if that makes a difference which most of the people of Charleston believe. The town has many explanations for the flooding but we have to examine all possible reasons. The meteorologistês reason has been ruled out because of the land improvements and the very little bit of more rain.",3,3,4,0E 328,My claim is the Charlestonês flooding problems are caused by land development and            ,,,,E 329,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to increases in land areas with impermeable surfaces. The increases increase of roads and buildings which are due to the increase of population causes rain water to stay at lower areas. If the water stays in the lower areas they will flood. The solution for the flooding is to make more dirt and gravel roads where the water normally ends up at. The meteorologistês claim is incorrect because for example in a city it may rain once a year but every time it rains for 7 days straight. It would flood because there is no stopping the rain from falling. Another way it could flood is if the city was built in a large crater type area with lots of impermeable surfaces, again only raining once a year for 7 days. My point is it doesnêt matter how often it rains it matters how much it rains each time it rains.",,,,E 330,"The local meteorologist says that The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. I do not believe this is accurate. The reasoning is if you take a look at graph one, in 2013 Charlestonês precipitation was about 59%. In graph two (2013), natural areas and developed-permeable surfaces were decreasing and developed-impermeable surfaces were increasing. My argument is Charlestonês flooding problem is due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. I believe this, because in graph two (2013), natural land and permeable surfaces were increasing, and surfaces with more impermeable areas. So, when it rains, there are fewer places for the rain to flow into. Therefore, this will lead to flooding in the streets, buildings, and sidewalks.",2,3,3,4E 331,"The town of Charleston has had a lot of flooding in the past couple years. A middle school class is explaining their argument to a meteorologist who disagrees whit them. I believe the meteorologistês argument is inaccurate because the meteorologist said, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. In the middle school childrenês claim, they explained that this flooding problem could have been caused by one of three things. Those three things could have been, a) Developed-impermeable surfaces, b) Developed-permeable surfaces,  and  c) Natural Areas. Developed-impermeable surfaces are surfaces that humans have created with materials that donêt let water pass through like sidewalks, buildings, and roads. Developed-permeable surfaces are areas that humans have created that allow water to pass through such as, soccer fields that are covered with grass. To sum that up, you could say their claim was Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The middle school children then, provided evidence for their claim with two different graphs.  In graph one, you can tell that flooding in Charleston has been a problem many years before 2005. In 1963, you can see the average amount of precipitation is about 58-60 inches. Then, from around 1973 to the late 1990ês-early 2000ês, that the precipitation amount decreased. Then about 2003, the precipitation average started to arise again and is going up throughout the years. So with this graph, it doesnêt provide us a lot of good evidence for their claim. Letês move on to the next graph. In graph two, it gives us three forms of data for five different dates. From this graph we can see that, over the years, natural areas coverage has decreased by 30%. You can also see that Developed-Permeable Surfaces has increased by 7%. Then, we can see that Developed-Impermeable Surfaces has increased by 23%. This graph gives us a great amount of evidence to support their claim. Now from this data, we can see that the amount of rain fall is not the only reason that Charleston has been flooding. We can see that manmade surfaces play a big part into why Charleston is flooding. This leads me to believe that the meteorologistês argument is inaccurate and the middle school childrenês claim is accurate.",3,4,4,4E 332,"The city of Charleston flooding problem is not because of increased precipitation. I think that that the statement about increases precipitation is wrong because even if we get more rain, the water should be doing the same thing. It should not be flooding homes and stores, it should be draining into a well, or it should be going into the ground for the trees and other plants. But, there are not a lot of trees or plants left in Charleston because of the increase of population. Instead of draining into to the well it goes into houses and stores because the water has no other place to go. If you look at the graph the natural areas has decreased by 30%. That means that 30% of our wildlife is gone because of people tearing it down to make more and more houses. I think that we need to be more resourceful with our surroundings.

Charlestonês flooding problems is due to the increases of impermeable surfaces because it doesnêt soak down all the rain drops properly so it starts to build up all the rain drops and it starts to flood. Then when it floods the surfaces take time to dry so, then it floods again and the surfaces gets damage more and more so, then it gets harder for it to soak up all the rain drops and the surfaces they use these days are made out of material that is weaker, then the ones in the old days and its cause more floods.

The annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. But I strongly disagree because the amount of precipitation in about 1970 was higher than in 2005 and flooding did not occur. This leads me to believe that the amount of precipitation was not the cause of the flooding. I believe that Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. In 1973 what made up Charleston was only 13% impermeable surfaces. But in 2003 around the time the flooding started Charleston was made up of 21% impermeable surfaces, which I think caused the flooding. I believe that because impermeable surfaces do not let water sink through them the water runs off into the sewers or lake and ponds and cause them to flood. In 2013 Charleston is made up of 36% impermeable surfaces which made the flooding worse. If Charleston doesnêt stop developing impermeable surfaces the amounts of flooding could soon become disastrous. Land developers should stop using impermeable surfaces and instead use permeable surfaces to help control the flooding. ",,,,E 336,What do you know about water systems? I know that the water runs through pipes and if the pipes get clog then it may cause a flood so if youêre putting down land areas the check to make sure you donêt hit a pipe. Charlestonês flooding problem are due to the increase of land areas and so thatês where the problem come because when people put down land areas there losing ways to get more water so how to solve this problem is simple all Charleston has to do is stop putting land areas and the problem will be fix because when we put down land there also messing up the pipes so then no more water can go through it then the pipes will clog up then cause a big flood  so to avoid that form happing  you need check to if there is any pipes before you start putting down land areas.      ,,,,E 337,"What do i know about water systems?  well, i know that water systems are  a building there is a whole lot of pipes with water running through and the water goes through the pipes ending up in or kitchens and bathrooms.

CHARELSTONêS FLOODING PROBLEM DUE TO THE INCREASES IN DEVELOPED LAND BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE LIKE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS OR ANY BODY ELSE IT CAUSES MORE FLOODING BECAUSE IT IS TO MUCH LAND SO IT WILL CAUSE THE WATER SYSTEM TO MESS UP SO IT WILL BE THE AMONT OF PERCIPITATION WILL GO UP AND DOWN AND KEEP GOING THAT SAME PATTERN BY WHEN THE YEARS PASS BY AND THEN THE GRAPHS OF WHICH THE DIFFERENT SURFACES OF WHICH MAY HAVE CAUSED THE FLOOD.

In the investigation 2 graphs were created graphing Precipitation patterns in Charleston, and Changes in land Area Coverage in Charleston. Graph 1 (Precipitation patterns in Charleston 1963-2013) lists in 1963 the annual average precipitation (inch) was 50 inches compared to 2013 which was 60 inches, Charlestonês average precipitation had increased by 10 inches.

The Developed-Impermeable Surface percentage had increased by 23% and the Natural Areas had decreased by 30%. Graph 2 clearly proves that Charlestonês flooding problem isnêt caused by precipitation, the flooding was caused by the increase of Developed-Impermeable Surface and the decrease in Natural Areas because there was such an drastic change in the land coverage, it caused the precipitated liquid to get blocked off from open grassland areas and flood the city instead of soaking into the ground like it originally should have. ",3,4,2,4E 339,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Charleston, a city founded in the early 1900ês, has experienced excessive flooding, which can cause property damage. Since this has concerned many of the residents, a local middle school science class collected data for the annual amount of precipitation over the last 50 years, and the percentage of land use such as, developed-impermeable surfaces, developed-permeable surfaces, and natural areas. The results show that annually, there was about 68in. of rain in 1973 and 2013, but only about 33in. in 1983 and 2003. The results also show that as the natural areas decreased over the years, the developed surfaces increased. As the percentage of developed-impermeable surfaces, which doesnêt allow water to seep through, was quickly rising, so were the amount of floods. With 36% developed-impermeable surfaces, this allows less and less rain and snowfall to be soaked into the ground, resulting in flooding. As increased developed-impermeable surfaces, like asphalt, concrete, buildings, and roads, are created, the precipitation will have very few places to soak into. Although, a local meteorologist would like to disagree with this. After seeing the data from the middle school science class, the meteorologist inferred that The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, the precipitation has led to local flooding. The meteorologist is right, the precipitation has increased since 2005, but at about 68in., there is an equal amount of precipitation now, in 2013, as it was in 1973. So, why wouldnêt there be a lot of flooding in 1973? The only answer is that in 1973 there were only 13% developed-impermeable surfaces, giving a way for the precipitation to soak up, but now there are 36% developed-impermeable surfaces, giving fewer spots for the precipitation to soak up. So, to come to conclusion, Charlestonês excessive flooding is due to the increase in developed-impermeable land areas, not because of the amount of rain and snowfall.",4,4,4,4E 340,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land with impermeable surfaces. In the second graph the developed- impermeable surfaces grew to almost double its amount from 1973 to 2003, and then doubled again in 2013. Since the word impermeable means water or liquids canêt go through those surfaces. Since the natural areas and developed permeable surfaces decreased over the time period from the graph the city area is not absorbing as much water from the rain. The meteorologist claim (The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation.) is inaccurate because in graph one Charlestonês precipitation amount was just as high in1973 as in 2013, but they didnêt have a problem in 1973.  So the reason that in 1973 they didnêt have a problem is that there were more natural areas than developed impermeable surfaces.",3,4,4,4E 341,I think the claim the meteorologistês claim is inaccurate. He/she said that in 2005 the Precipitation increased steadily since about 2005. But she/he was wrong because it wasnêt steady it was more of a bumpy then a nice in steady. Plus in none of the graphs did it say anything about floods. So it must have had to have used his/her background knowledge skills. But then again the tittle of the experiment is Charlestonês flooding problem. So they have the graph for precipitation & area coverage but what they did not show is what year the floods took place.  ,1,1,2,0E 342,"The citizens of Charleston have noticed that the city flood each time it rains heavily. Flooding had never been a problem until 2005. The Charlestonês water system has been created with materials that do not allow water to go through like sidewalks, buildings and roads. Developed-permeable surfaces are areas that humans have created with materials that allow water to go through soccer fields covered with grass. Natural areas are spaces that have not been developed by humans like rain forest areas. The Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed lands areas with impermeable surfaces because impermeable surfaces is water that cannot go through like sidewalks, buildings, roads and grass. The water increases because while the floods forming from the rain, also the water seeks though the grass and while the flood forms the grass seeks the water though the dirt and roots. The meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because the city has a lot of houses and sores and all kinds of stuff that when the flooding hits it will destroy the peoples town, houses and stores that for a while they wonêt have nothing to eat or change their clothes because it all got destroyed by the flooding. ",,,,E 343,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Graphs have shown that in 1963 they had quite a lot of precipitation and 13 impermeable surfaces and over the years the precipitation has dropped and then around 2004-2005 that changed while we added more and more impermeable surfaces. As we intentionally added more of these surfaces we got more and more floods. I respectfully disagree with the meteorologistês statement The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem has increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data shows that rain and snowfall in the area has increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. Mostly, because when they got floods they had gotten less and less precipitation. Lastly, because, flooding was a problem before 2005 if we got more precipitation every year because of flooding then in 1963 flooding would have been a huge problem. My claim will stay the same based on this data from the graphs. On one these graphs it shows not just how much precipitation we had in 1963 up until 2013 but, it shows how over the years it has dropped (less impermeable surfaces) and then increased (because we added more impermeable surfaces). The second graph shows how much of natural lands had dropped (to be able to make more impermeable lands) and permeable surfaces have increased by 2 every 10 years. Impermeable surfaces have increased so much over every 10 years at first from 1973 to 1983 it increased by 2. Then from 1983 to 1993 it increased three. After that it jumped from 1993 to 2003 by three. Last but not least it jumped from 2003 to 2013 by a total of 15. Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. (Is my claim and will always be) which is in my opinion the truth while as The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem has increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data shows that rain and snowfall in the area has increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. (will always be the meteorologists first claim hopefully based of my information this meteorologist will change his mind.) ",,,,E 344,"In the graphs provided for me, it shows how in Natural areas of Charlestonês town the amount of flooding goes down, but in the Developed-Permeable and Developed-Impermeable surfaces the flooding has gone up. Does this have an effect on what the meteorologists have to say? Yea, it does! If you noticed on the graph it shows how Developed-Impermeable surfaces have increased on amount of flooding since 1973. It still is going up today! Now one meteorologist says, Flooding did not become a problem in the city until 2005. This meteorologist claims that flooding wasnêt a problem, and now it is. I disagree. If this meteorologist looked in the past he/she would know that this amount of flooding was creeping up on you all along. The meteorologist also claims that all the flooding is a local problem, not just the townês problem, thatês where I disagree again. It may look as if itês gone local, but it only looks like that because of the amount of land this town has. I believe all the flooding is because of all the land Charlestonês town has and that the local meteorologist is inaccurate. Evidence I have to prove this is, one when Charlestonês town was found it was small, but over time it grew larger and larger, when finally in 1973 flooding began, and in 2005 a terrible flood happened, which got everyoneês attention about the amount of floods they have. Also another reason is how students in a local middle school started collecting data to see how much precipitation has happened over the years. These results are the graph that they provided for me to test this claim. All the evidence helps me support my claim by it tells me when the flooding first happened and what others have to say and how they deal with it. I believe that if the meteorologist has something to say, first check the data you have then say it, also if the citizens are concerned, then take action and do something like build a water system for the water to go too. It works! This is all I have to say about this Scenario! Thank you!!!                                           ",3,2,2,2E 345,"In the article, the meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because it is not just the increase in precipitation that caused the flooding. It was also the developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. For example, on the graph it says that from 1973 to 2013 there was a 23 percent increase in the number of developed impermeable surfaces ( areas that are human made and do not allow water to go through it, an example is a sidewalk or building) and a 30 percent decrease in natural areas ( an area that has not been developed by humans like forests or lakes) and a 7 percent increase in developed permeable surfaces ( areas that humans created with materials that allow the water to go through it like a soccer field or a sponge).  This change caused the water to start sliding down hill towards the city of Charleston. Also, from 1963-2013 there was an 8 percent increase on how much precipitation the city got. This caused the amount of water that slide downhill towards the city to increase. In conclusion; all of this data is what caused the city to start flooding so much.",4,4,4,4E 346,"The meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because they said that Charlestonês problem with flooding is caused by the increase of precipitation since 2005. Well that is inaccurate because the graph provided says that the average fall of precipitation was very high through the years of 1963 and 1973 and after those years the precipitation levels dropped severely. The meteorologist said that flooding became a problem in 2005 when the years of 1963 through 1973 had 50 to 60 inches of rain fall. Flooding had to happen earlier than 2005 because the levels of precipitation were very high. That doesnêt mean that the meteorologist was wrong about the growth of precipitation over the years because like I said after about the year of 1973 the levels in precipitation dropped, but over the past years the levels in precipitation have grown into the levels they were in the years of 1963 through 1973. The correct claim is Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. This claim is correct because the second graph that was provided showed the changes in land area coverage in Charleston. This graph showed that the Natural Areas in Charleston since the year of 1973 have dropped slowly over the past years till 2003. Then after 2003 the Natural Areas have dropped drastically till 2013. The Natural Areas are spaces that have not been developed by humans like forest areas.  I think those numbers have dropped because people are cutting down more trees and wood and that leaves more space for water to move in. Also over the years the Developed-Permeable Surfaces have grown slightly over the years, but just that little amount can make a big difference. But over the years the city has been backing up the other systems that have been growing smaller, with them having more Developed-Impermiable Surfaces. Developed-Impermiable Surfaces are areas that humans have created with materials that do not allow water to go through like sidewalks, buildings, and roads. But the city has not grown with that system enough to keep all flooding out. To keep all the flooding out they need to build more of the Developed-Impermiable Surfaces to make sure there city doesnêt have more damage done to them. My evidence supports the claim because I used information about the cityês precipitation levels and land area coverage from two graphs that were provided. The graphs also provided the years that Charleston has had high precipitation levels and developed and un-developed land coverageês. So all the information means that Charlestonês problem is due to the fact that the increases in developed land areas with Impermiable surfaces have caused flooding.",,,,E 347,"The reasons of the flooding could be because of, the changes in the, Natural Areas, but every time it changes, it goes lower. When it does change it doesnêt change that much. It only changes like a few less. I donêt see how the flooding could be because of the areas, or the Developed-Impermeable Surfaces because, the areas have nothing to do about it. To me it looks like they need some dams. If they build some dams, there would be no flooding, and their problem would be solved. The story says, Developed-Impermeable Surfaces is materials that keep the water out, so what they need to do is, make more Developed-Impermeable Surfaces and their problem will be solved. What else would fix their problem is, stop making so much Developed-permeable surfaces because, thatês what allows the water to come in. I think that Natural Areas have nothing to do with it because, thatês just forest, or the woods. Graph number two says that the Natural Areas are going down, so how is flooding happening because the changes in the Natural Areas? Charleston is saying that flooding didnêt start happening until 2005, but thatês when the natural Areas, was the lowest. I think the solution would be, build a dam, or build more, Developed-Impermeable Surfaces.",,,,E 348,The flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The local meteorologist claim is wrong because the data on graph 2 shows that the natural land is going away and there is more soccer fields than natural land and the developed permeable surfaces have grown more and developed permeable surfaces gain more water thatês why there is a increase in flooding in Charleston precipitation is not the problem of the flooding.,,,,E 349," Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. I think the meteorologist is right because he said the annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increase steadily since about 2005.Flooding had never been a problem for Charleston until about 2005,but the floods have increase in frequency ever since. In 1963 the precipitation patterns in Charleston had went up to 52, then 1983 it went down to 33, back up in 2003 to 33-34, then the precipitation up and 2013 to 60.In graph 2 the changes in land areas coverage in Charleston by the most is Natural Areas. The least is Developed-permeable surfaces and the most, most is Developed-impermeable surface.  Till then it stay down and got heavier ever time it rains. A critique of the meteorologistês argument is inaccurate because it said he said the flooding didnêt come a problem until 2005. The Charleston had notice the city flood each time it rains.",3,2,3,2E 350,"The local meteorologists had said The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data shows that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. But I believe Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. I believe this because as the developed impermeable surfaces increased so did the precipitation patterns. In 1973 the impermeable surfaces was 13 but the precipitation was around 52. As the impermeable surfaces began to change so did the pattern, the natural areas continued to get lower as the impermeable surfaces continued to get higher. But one day in 2013 the impermeable surfaces was the highest it has ever been and the precipitation was the highest too. Therefore I believe that only the impermeable surfaces had an impact on the precipitation because the precipitation was not at its highest when the natural areas or developed permeable surfaces were high. Also I think my evidence supports the claim Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces, because I took my observations from both graphs and stated it in my argument. The reason why I believed the meteorologist reasoning is inaccurate is because in both graphs it never stated the precipitation or changes in land covering, in Charleston, in 2005. So that leads me to believe that he guessed. So if the meteorologist guessed thatês not helping us solve the flooding problem in Charleston, which again means his statement was inaccurate.",,,,E 351,"In the city Charleston had a flooding problem in 2005 because of rain and snow. In a local middle school science class, they were investigating the flooding problem. They investigate on a Developed-impermeable surface, a Developed _permeable surface, and Natural areas. In the Developed-impermeable surface, are lands use divide into three categories, in the Developed-permeable surface, humans have created buildings and roads, and in Natural areas are spaces that have not been developed by humans. The local meteorologistsê claim in 2005 the numbers increase until 2013. ",,,,E 352,Charlestonês flood problems are due to increase in developing land areas because in 1973 we only had 13 developed impermeable surfaces but in 2013 we had 36 developed impermeable surfaces which caused the flood because houses and streets is not soaking the water up and thatês causing it to flood. ,,,,E 353,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases and decreases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The local meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because in the area it hasnêt increased steadily since about 2005. From graph #1 what it shows is how Animal Average Precipitation (inch) changes each year. And in graph #2 what it shows is how the Changes in land Area Coverage in Charleston each year. From the information that I got from the graphs I can tell that precipitation patters and the changes in land area change constantly. It really doesnêt have a pattern to go with or to tell what the next change will be. I diffidently disagree from what the meteorologist says and what its conclusion is because the problem isnêt the precipitation is being increased. There are more changes then just being increased. There are times that it is also being decreased not just increased as I said you will not be able to tell whether is it going to decrease or increase next year because it has a lot of changes. A lot decreasing and a lot of increasing are going on, in Charleston. In graph #1 around 1963 the average is between 50 and 60 which is high, in 1973-1983 the average goes down to be between 30 and 40. In 1993 it kind of goes high a little bit to be between 40 and from 2003-2013 it goes up higher to be by the 60ês. In graph #2 I can tell that it does have a pattern to go with, each year it decreases and in graph #1 you canêt tell if itês going to increase or decrease.",,,,E 354," Graph 2: Based off the fact that there are more natural areas than both developed permeable and impermeable surfaces; the water would have to go somewhere. And seeing that the roots of the trees and all other forms of plant life in Charleston would have to consume Iêd say about 39.5% of the water because the amount of water consumed depends on how old or big the tree or other form of plant life is. Say a 150 year old oak tree its roots would be somewhere to 8-10 feet long and about 1-2 feet thick so it would have a maximum capacity of about 5-10 gallons of water in total because the diameter of the roots would recalibrate and start to curve causing a circular chamber like a spiral staircase. Graph 1: After examining graphês 1 and 2 I see that the decrease in Natural Areas had caused a slight fall then it continuously started to rise and fall until the developed permeable surfaces had risen to be almost equal to the same quantity as the natural areas there was a slight difference in the developed surfaces seeing that the impermeable surfaces had started to cover more and the Natural land coverage had gone down because of the rise of the amount of buildings allowing more impermeable surfaces to be made. The meteorologist is incorrect or inaccurate because he does not know the independent variable for this investigation, every investigation, experiment, etc. Needs to have both an independent and dependent variable for the experiment to be able to actually work, the independent variable would have to be what causes the exceeding amounts of rain so, rain is water that is evaporated condensed and released from storm or rain clouds because the maximum capacity has been reached to where it has to start over again. This is known as the water cycle, the water cycle is how water or rain makes its way from Oceans, Rivers, and Lakes to being steam or mist that heats up like and floats upwards like helium in a balloon. I say that the independent variable is sunlight and the dependent variable is actually the amount of rain that falls every year in Charleston.  A constant variable in this experiment would be the number years passed and if Charleston had actually flooded or not. Iêm saying this because how else would an area like Charleston be able to flood if it didnêt have enough Natural Areas to soak up the rain but enough rooftops of buildings to hold in the rain until it overflows and ends up flooding? The amount of buildings with caved in rooftops would be another variable in this experiment because if there were 30 buildings with a rectangular rooftop of 10x30 in feet then that would allow almost 1000 feet in rain to fall onto the streets and potentially end up flooding the town in just a small amount of time then again it actually depends on the rate that the rain is actually falling at. The temperature would also play a part in the amount of rain because it would depend on the amount of water that was actually evaporated in the amount of time that the sun was in temperatures hot enough to evaporate partial bodies of water to make it actually able to compact enough rain to fill a cloud and make the cloud to be in Charleston. The reason Iêm stating what I think is because Iêm pulling information from what I know from science already and putting it to use and using other resources like the graphs on the paper that show the yearly rate of rain in a span of 10 years it is showing how much rain is actually falling per decade for every time it actually floods Charleston it means there would have been enough rain to potentially fill more than 300 bottles of water and seal it off completely.",2,1,2,0E 355,(no content),,,,E 356,"The Charleston flooding issue is due to the amount of building that has gown of the last 50 years. Ever since 1973 them, highest rain fall amount in the 20th century, has shown that if we build the buildings and housing too much it in too little of time then we will see some changes in the weather, Because the humans are changing the environment in that area the earth has to compensate for that by putting more water of what the world need in the area. In graph 2 it give the date over the natural areas developed permeable surfaces, and developed impermiable surfaces. In a time of 50 years the developed impermiable surfaces has gone up 23 places for building. The developed permeable surfaces have also gone up but by 7. In that the natural areas have been going down in the number of spots by 30. So where the humans are building they tacking away the soil and the absorption from the ground. When it rains the natural areas canêt absorb that much rain that is falling in a short amount of time because they arenêt as many natural place for the rain to feed the plants and trees and all of the things in the natural areas. The meteorologist says that wrong. He says that the rain fall has gone up steadily. But he does not have the date that can prove what he is saying. But the children do the graph that show the rain fall says that the in 1973 the town of Charleston all most his the 60 inch mark. It is 55-57 then it takes a big drop in 83 to about 31-33 inch range. It went up about ten in 93. The rain went down again in 2003 to 30-31. The sky rocked in 2013 to 60 inch mark. If that is steady to a meteorologist then he needs to go fine a new job because look at all that movement from 1973 to 2013 it got from 50ês to the 30ês and back up to the 60 inch mark. The meteorologist should have said I think this because from 1973 to 2013 it is in the same area. The students would say but it went down to the 30ês in 1983-2003. Then they would say, where your evidence. The students would win because they gave the evidence to support what they were saying the to the meteorologist. They had a graph they had the developments. So in the end thatês why all flooding is happening in the town of Charleston. Add more natural places in Charleston.",,,,E 357,"The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005.Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. Well you meteorologist person, I have something to say about that. Your argument is inaccurate because if there is an increased amount of precipitation, the water cycle tells us that there would be an increased amount of runoff and there would be collection and it would start over again. So it would be fine. But since itês not fine and Charleston is still getting overwhelmed by flooding, this meteorologist is incorrect. There has to be another reason and I know exactly what the reason is. Charlestonês flooding problem isnêt because of the increased precipitation since 2003, but rather because of the amount of developed land areas with permeable surfaces since 2003 (Developed impermeable surfaces are areas that humans have created with materials that do not allow water to pass through them). This is because of the water cycle. The water cycle says that after precipitation comes runoff, then collection. But there has mas been decrease of the amount of places for the water to run off and collect at because of the amount of developed impermeable surfaces that have been steadily increasing in creation since 2003. Since there are not many places to run off to, more precipitation starts melting and collecting on the surface, not going to collect somewhere that is made out of materials soft enough that water can pass through, which are known as developed-permeable surfaces. Donêt get me wrong, on the graph it shows that the amount of developed-permeable surfaces in Charleston are increasing over time, but not fast as the precipitation is increasing. My evidence supports my claim because I gave reasons that make since and I know that if that town of Charleston came up with a solution that was based on my reasons, *cough cough make more developed-permeable surfaces cough cough*, they would have no more problems with flooding.",,,,E 358,In the data that I collated I say it was increase once in a year or more.

The first graph explains the precipitation patterns in Charleston; the next graph shows changes in land area coverage in Charleston. The class invited local metrologies to examine their data. Charleston flooding problems are due to the increases in development land areas with impermeable surfaces. The meteorologist is wrong because he said Charleston flooding problems are from the increased precipitation. Just because it rains more does not mean it always floods.

This is true because about 2005 is when Developed-Impermeable surfaces increased. Impermeable surfaces are surfaces that humans have created with materials that do not allow water to go through like sidewalks, buildings, and roads. When water cannot go anywhere, it will start to stay together and will become something like a swimming pool, which some will think of when they think of floods. The meteorologists claim is inaccurate because even though precipitation is one of the problems, itês not the whole reason. Rain and snow falls lots of places, and doesnêt flood. Natural areas or Developed-Permeable areas could help a lot because in these places, there is somewhere for water to go. It wouldnêt just build up in one place.

But I still think that will hurt the human population because of water loss. I would say the pattern is random from my point of view. From all I know about floods is that they do not happen because of land gain I think it is just the wind and how the wind will push force against the water and pick up force and pus hit towards land. What heês saying is that there is some kind of pattern like flood on certain dates. I however looked it up and found out that waves are actually the most common things on beaches and will have some big enough to reach up to the cities or states by the beach. Floods are one of very little numbers uncommon catastrophes that are in the world like tornadoes or hurricanes or maybe forest fires. I think the flood is not one of the most common like little waves, or rain, or thunder, or maybe even a little bonfire around a wood house something that can be stopped quickly or can be stopped at all.

The data all supports this clearly. The claim that the cause of the flooding is increased precipitation is inaccurate. The reason is that in 1973 the city had a similar amount of rainfall compared to today. So if the claim was accurate there would have been flooding in 1973.

For this reason the precipitation is stuck outside in the air and on the ground and the more precipitation that falls from the ground is the more precipitation that is building up outside of the buildings and because the precipitation isnêt being sucked through the cracks of sidewalks and the roads the precipitation is clogging up and increasing which is why Charleston is having a flooding problem.

Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. I believe that this is incorrect because if there werenêt any buildings then all of the rain would sink into natural areas (the ground) and therefore there would not be any flooding. I believe that the cause for Charlestonês flooding is all of the new developed land areas with impermeable surfaces for the same concept of if there werenêt any new buildings there wouldnêt be any or as much flooding.",2,4,2,1E 382,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces because in the developed- Impermiable surfaces in 1973 it was at 13 percentage then it stared to increase to 36 percentage in 2013. The Developed- impermeable surfaces are the areas that humans have created with materials that do not allow water to go through like sidewalks, buildings, and roads. When it rains all the water moves and it does not sock into the side walk because it has no where to go that the water turns into floods. The natural areas in 1973 were at 75 percentages that they decrease to 45 percentages in the year of 2013. The natural areas are spaces that have not been developed by humans like forest areas because the water socks into the underground and that they built more sidewalks and parking lots. The developed permeable surfaces are areas that humans have created with materials that allows water to go through like soccer fields covered with grass. That the permeable surfaces was at 12 percentage then it increase to 19 percentage. Then the citizens of Charleston have noticed that the city floods each time it rains heavily because when the people built the city that they did not make something that could carry the water to go through underground.    ",2,4,0,4E 383,"Charlestonês flood happened because they do not have enough land area for water to go so they will have floods. Most of the floods leave a lot of damage behind. Every time it rains it HEAVILY poorês down. In 1963 there was an average of 50 inches of rain, in 20013 there was an average of 60 inches of rain. Charleston was not worried about the floods until 2005 but the floods have increased ever since. Citizens are concerned because floods can cause property damage. ",,,,E 384,"The Charlestonês flooding problem is due to the fact the towns amount of impermeable surfaces are increasing.  The amount of precipitation has gone up a lot in recent years according to the graph of Precipitation patterns in Charleston (1963-2013). According to the evidence provided by the graph the annual average of Charleston of precipitation in 2013 is 60 inches. Also if you take into consideration the graph Changes in land Area Coverage in Charleston the towns amount of developed-impermeable surfaces has gone up which allows the excess precipitation to flow freely, which would cause the towns flooding. The local meteorologists claim is inaccurate because the meteorologist did not take into consideration the graph Changes in land Area Coverage in Charleston. In that graph it states the townês amount of developed-impermeable surfaces has gone up, not just the precipitation. Due to the fact that the developed-impermeable also allow precipitation to flow, it would be a more accurate reason for the towns flooding problem. In conclusion, The Charleston Flooding problem is due to the townês amount of developed-impermeable surfaces, and not the precipitation amount.",,,,E 385,The meteorologist argument said that increased precipitation is the cause of local floods. Also the claim is Charlestonês flooding problem are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces is inaccurate because impermeable surfaces are not supposed to let or allow water to get through them as stated in paragraph two.The claim Charlestons flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. If there was less impermeable surfaces then the water would flow easier because if water flows then is not build up and make floods. Like when it rains in flat land the water flows and there is no floods thanks to nothing stopping the flow of the water. So the claim is accurate because without the buildings the heavy rain would be able to flow and then it canêt build up and cause a flood. Also the buildings donêt allow water to flow through them and not mess anything up and since if the water flows through the buildings and nothing inside the building gets messed up then there would be floods but I guess that is a little advanced or it is so in your face that it is invisible I donêt really know but with less buildings there will be less floods.,2,4,3,4E 386,"Over the years since 1973, people of Charleston have built or used more buildings and things with developed-impermeable surfaces. Developed _Impermeable surfaces are areas that humans have created with materials that do not allow water to go through like sidewalks, buildings, and roads. When a middle school science class investigated the problem and got data, the results for their graph Changes in land Area Coverage in Charleston were in 1973 there was a 75% of a natural area, 12% of developed-permeable surfaces, and 13% of developed-impermeable surfaces; 1983 there was a 72% of natural areas, 13% of developed-permeable surfaces, and 15% of developed-impermeable surfaces: 1993 there was 67% of natural areas, 15% of developed-permeable surfaces, and 18% of developed-impermeable surfaces; 2003 there was 62% of natural area, 17% of developed-permeable surfaces, and 21% of developed-impermeable surfaces, and lastly in 2013 there was 45% of natural areas, 19% of developed-permeable surfaces, and 36% of developed-impermeable surfaces. Between 2003 and 2013 there is a huge decrease in natural areas and increase in developed permeable and impermeable surfaces. The meteorologistês argue that the cause of more flooding is because of more precipitation and rain but that is not the case, the case is the fact that the people of Charleston have been building and using more things that have materials that water from the rain cannot go through and they also have less natural areas for all the water to go to when it rains. In the information I stated above it shows that natural areas are decreasing through the years and more buildings are being built with materials that water canêt go through so the water is going to the streets and have no place to go, which causes Charleston to flood.",2,4,3,4E 387,"The city of Charleston has grown a lot over the last 10 years increasing the amount of schools and homes with a growing population but citizens are reporting that the city floods when it rains heavily, Charleston has never had problems with flooding in the past until about 2005 when floods started to happen more frequently. A local middle school has collected data over this problem showing Charlestonês precipitation over the last 50 years and the amount of land used for different purposes. The classês data shows that its Developed-Impermiable Surfaces have increased along with the amount of precipitation since 2005 going up by over 20 inches. The class hired a local meteorologist to examine their data who argued The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increase in precipitation. The annual precipitation data shows the rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. However in this claim the meteorologist fails to explain why from about 1960-1975 when city had the same amount of precipitation flooding was not an issue. Therefore an increase in precipitation cannot be the only thing causing Charlestonês flooding. The classês data also shows that when the city started to experience flooding they had a drastic increase in the amount of Developed-Impermiable Surfaces. This along with increased levels of precipitation could be a major cause of the flooding; therefore Charlestonês flooding problems are due to increasing Developed-Impermiable Surfaces and an increase in precipitation.  ",,,,E 388,Charlestonê  flooding inaccurate because Iêm guessing  that thereês not enough place for the water to go to or the Charleston is just packed with a lot of thing which is cause the it to flood cause in the story it says  new schools and many homes to meet the needs of its growing population. It also expanded existing roads and built new sidewalks in the graph it shows how the natural areas are decreasing each year but the permeable and impermeable surfaces are increasing. In 1963 it really increase then it slowly went down then it came back up. Developed _permeable surfaces are the area that humans have created with materials that allow water to go through soccer fields covered with grass. Natural areas are like forest so that why the natural area is going down  cause maybe the water sinks into the ground,,,,E 389,"The meteorologistês data is inaccurate because the flooding was not because of the land it was from the river. Floods are caused by heavy rain not how flat or curvy a land is. In 1973 the Developed-Interminable surfaces was on 12%. In 1983 the Developed-Interminable Surfaces was 13%. In 1993 the Developed-Interminable surfaces was on 15%. In 2003 the Developed-Interminable surfaces was only 17%. In 2013 the Developed-Interminable surfaces was only 19%. As you can see the data has increased but that still doesnêt mean that was the cause of the floods. Sometimes when it rainês plants grow. But in Charleston when it rains heavily thereês a flood. Buildings are destroyed homes, personal items are lost but that still doesnêt mean you canêt celebrate. In New Orleans after the Level 5 Hurricane Katrina people still have a good time. People would play music, dance around, and have picnics even though they just lost their homes. In New Orleans when bad things happen they still find a way to celebrate or have a party. In 1963 there was 53 inches of rain. In 1973 there was 58 inches of rain. In 1983 there was 34 inches of rain. In 1993 there was 42 inches of rain. In 2003 there was 35 inches of rain. In 2013 there was 60 inches of rain. There was more changes in the rain increase than the lane area coverage. The might have been a lot of Natural area but each time it rained they decreased. Same thing with the Rainfall, sometimes it increased sometimes it decreased. ",,,,E 390,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Impermeable surfaces are things humans have made that do not allow water to go through. Impermeable surfaces have increased by 26% over the past fifty years. As the number of impermeable surfaces increases the less space there is for water. This makes water flow into streams or ponds that will eventually over flow causing a flood. The meteorologistês claim, The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increases precipitation. The annual precipitation data shows that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005Ä is inaccurate. The annual precipitation data does not show the amount of precipitation increasing steadily. Between 2008 and 2013 the precipitation patterns increased a lot compared to the patterns from 2003 to 2008. The graph, Changes in land Area Coverage in Charleston shows natural areas decreasing, while impermeable surfaces are increasing. This shows that when you take away natural areas that allow water to go through, and replace them with impermeable surfaces that do not allow water to go through, the risk of having a flood increases. Charlestonês flooding problem is caused by the development of impermeable surfaces. Impermeable surfaces are going to cause the water to build up in one specific area, and then eventually get to a point where there is no longer room for the water, causing a flood to happen. Buildings, sidewalks, and roads stop water from being absorbed into the ground. In natural areas water is absorbed into the ground or falls into ponds, rivers, lakes, etc. In areas with impermeable surfaces the water cannot be absorbed because there is a building or road in the way, or the water flows in to a pond. Although impermeable surfaces allow water to flow into other bodies of water, it still is the issue. If water continues to flow into bodies of water like ponds and rivers, there will not be enough space in that area which will lead to flooding. ",3,4,4,4E 391,"The meteorologists claim is inaccurate because the flooding was not caused by the increase in rain and snow fall, it is caused by the increase in Developed-impermeable Surfaces. I know this because in 1963-1973 the precipitation was also 50-60, but that was before we could put in the things that we have today. So the reason for the flooding is the Developed-impermeable Surfaces are keeping the water from soaking in to the ground so it is just accumulating in the streets, and sidewalks, and driveways. So what would be correct is      Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces.",,,,E 392,"Today I am discussing the Charlestonês flooding problem and itês due to the increases in developed land area with impermeable surfaces and I believe that the meteorologistês claim is  inaccurate because he said it was caused by the increase of precipitation. He thinks thatês the reason why since their increase in rain and snow fall started to increase steadily in 2005 and thatês when the flooded started to happen. As Iêm looking over their data I realize that on their line graph there were very high precipitation patterns in the 1960s and 70s but they never said that there was ever any flooding in the 60s or 70s for that matter so it canêt be the precipitation and I know it dropped but its risen to about the same height like in the 60s and 70s. I have also noticed that as humanity grew so did the creations we have made such as sidewalks, buildings, and roads and I realize those donêt soak up water like the materials they put in grass like at soccer fields. You donêt see a building soaking up water do u thatês because they donêt puddles just form and they sit there until the sun comes out and soaks them up. On the other hand there are things that soak up water like grass, trees, plants and the chemicals they put in the grass at soccer fields. They suck up the water to help them live and then they wait for sunlight and more water. That pretty much explains why the meteorologistês claim was inaccurate because of not only precipitation but because man kindês creations are causing it to do it for us, so thatês why flooding was caused by developed-impermeable surfaces and developed-permeable surfaces and natural areas.            ",4,3,4,4E 393,Charlestonês flooding is doing to the increases in developing land areas with impermeable surface this is because when something is natural it happened for a reason. When people come and build houses it is no longer natural. I think thatês why all of the flooding is happening. When the construction workers dig they make the ground flat so when it rains the water has nowhere to go and the water just keeps rising and until it floods the whole city. The meteorologist claims it to be inaccurate because there are more natural areas than developed areas. This some of the natural areas may be hills so still the water has nowhere to go. So it just building up and the water floods the city. When they made the schools they made the ground flat when it rained the water ran down the hills and flood the city.   ,0,2,3,1E 394,"I believe that the meteorologistês argument is accurate because, the flooding did start happening around the time of 2005. Thatês just around the time the people  in Charleston, started building more impermeable surfaces which is causing all the rain and snow precipitation to stay on ground level, causing floods. I also support the meteorologistês statement of argument because the graphs are applying to what heês saying. Heês saying that all the floods appeared when they started to build more roads and lands. Thatês what the second graph is showing, how much natural areas, permeable surfaces and impermeable surfaces there were during the years, starting at 1973 and ending in 2013.I strongly agree that the increasing precipitation is causing floods, the second graph is supporting that as well. Less of natural areas or developed impermeable the more youêre going to most likely get a flood. I know this because water has to have a source to sink into, or the water stays. Think of a counter top and a patch of fresh grass, with great soil. Pour water on the counter top, it stays, just as it does with roads, sidewalks, and more. Pour water on the patch of grass, it soaks in the soil, just like it would in reality. So basically the precipitation is the cause of the floods but the impermeable surfaces has a part of the problem as well. So the meteorologist is correct but needs a little more explain. He is supporting the claim heês given which in my eyes proves that his statement is accurate.                                                                                                                                                             ",,,,E 395,The meteorologist is wrong because the flooding in the Charleston area was as big in the 1900ês and then went down and slowly went up and down. The meteorologist claim is inaccurate because in the natural areas there was more rain fall in the 1900ês then there was in the 2000ês.  I believe that the less it rains in natural areas the more it rains in permeable and impermeable surfaces.  The my believe that the more rainfall  on surface areas the more floods that there are because the rain fall spreads and sits on natural areas were itês not going anywhere then itês just there in the developed permeable surface the water can be absorbed. I think that all the land should be developed permeable surfaces. My claim is that the more rain that falls over the natural area the more floods there are. My evidence is that the developed permeable surface absorbs water and allows it to fall under the surface were as the natural area water just sits at the surface causing floods. In 2013 I predict there wouldnêt be a lot of flooding just a little flooding maybe not even a flood. If Charleston were to make changes and lessen the natural area rain fall and put some permeable surface it there things would change a lot. Another piece of evidence is that the patterns of precipitation would start to go down in 2013 due to the growth of permeable surfaces. The more surface area to let the water sit equals more evaporation which equals more rain. The meteorologist is inaccurate because the rain happens because the natural area lets water sit and the permeable surface takes it somewhere else. The meteorologist thinks that the impermeable land is hurting but itês really not because if Charleston built extra roads than the impermeable land would come into play and let the water run through to the sewers and  things like that. Charleston increase in the developed land would help the city and floods but not the precipitation levels. The developed lands job is to conduct the water.,4,4,4,0E 396,(no content),,,,E 397,"The argument is inaccurate because itês not the increase of land; itês the amount of precipitation. No matter how much land is in a town, city, or state the amount of rain, thunder, or lightning isnêt going to reflect off of the amount of land. Although, too much land is bad for the community. The amount of precipitation is making all the rain and flooding happen. In 2013 the precipitation was at its highest, which was at 60 inches. The precipitation has never gone lower than 30 inches. In 1973 the highest natural areas was at 75, and the lowest was in 2013 at that was at 45. My evidence supports the claim because they show why the original claim was inaccurate.             ",2,2,2,0E 398,"The meteorologist doesnêt support his argument besides just saying it did not become a problem besides 2005 because the precipitation. The meteorologist says that the precipitation increased and that is why there is flooding, but on the graph that graphed precipitation over the last 50 years says that in 1983 the precipitation increased as much when the flooding first started. Charlestonês flooding is because of the impermeable surfaces such as sidewalks. An impermeable surface is an area that does not soak up water. People keep building more and more impermeable surfaces which are causing flooding as the rain comes down because it cannot soak into the ground so it decides to float around and destroy land. In the graph about changes in land area coverage in Charleston developed-impermeable surfaces since 2005 have gone up and the natural areas are going down fast. I used the graph because It shows an accurate representation of how much more impermeable surfaces are being built and how many natural areas are being destroyed and their will probably be more that will be destroyed.",3,4,3,0E 399,"Charlestonês flooding problem is not caused by the increase in the amount of precipitation. The city was built in the early 1900s the problem did not start until about 2005 but, in 1963-1973 the amount of precipitation was about the same as now. If the amount of precipitation was to blame for the Charleston there would have been flooding in the 1960s through the 1970s. Therefor the meteorologist is incorrect. I believe that the Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. As a growing city Charleston has had to add more homes, schools, sidewalks and roads to accommodate to the needs of its growing population over the last ten years. The problem started in 2005 it is now 2015, impermeable surfaces are the areas humans create that water cannot penetrate. Impermeable surfaces have been added since the problem started and since more are being added constantly (the schools, sidewalks and roads) the problem will increase as the article suggests. The land has been changed a lot over the last 10 years. According to the graph Changes in land Area Coverage in Charleston the amount of developed impermeable surfaces has almost matched the amount of natural land which water can flow through and  help nourish plants and end up in the nearest stream, lake or river. Developed impermeable land is causing the flooding because the water cannot go anywhere it just accumulates over time. The data that students from the local school collected indicates developed land areas with impermeable surfaces have caused the flooding.  The growing population and the need for more buildings and roads have happened over the last ten years, ten years ago is when the problem started. Since then the amount of natural area has decreased. The Graph Precipitation pattern in Charleston tells me the amount of precipitation was about the same in the 1960s and 70s so the amount of precipitation is not to blame since flooding was not a problem then. In conclusion impenetrable surfaces are causing the flooding.",4,4,4,4E 400,The kids made graph about the amount of land used for different purposes. Measures of precipitation indicate how much rain and snow the city receives. My claim is because it had been raining more frequency and it is causing the sea level to raze. And the landscaping can make peloton can coals floods .      ,1,2,0,0E 401,"This claim is incorrect. I think this because in graph 2 as the years go by, the changes in land area coverage go down in Charleston. This supports my claim because the cause of the flooding is something else, not developed land areas with impermeable surfaces.",0,0,1,0E 402,"In 1963 the perception of rain was like 51 inches. In 1973 the perception of rain was about 40 inches of rain. In the year of 1983 the perception of rain was about 33 inches of rain that had fallen. In the year of 1993 the inches of rain that had fell was 31 inches. In 2003 the inches of rain that had fell was 32 inches of rain. In the year 2013 the rain fall was the worst because the rain .fall was up to 59 inches of rain fall. Graph 2 in 1973 the percentage of different surfaces was 75%, 12%of developed-permeable surfaces 13% of developed-impermeable surfaces. In 1983 the percentage was 75 and the permeable surfaces were 13% and impermeable surfaces were 15%.

",3,0,0,0E 403,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increase in developed-impermeable surfaces over the past 10 years. This means that claim by the local meteorologist; that the flooding is caused by increase in precipitation is not accurate. The meteorologistês claim is that the cause of flooding is the increase in precipitation. This claim is false because in the precipitation patterns graph it shows that precipitation has increased to an average of about 59 inches but in 1973, precipitation increased to a similar amount but there had not been flooding problems until the recent increase. So, the precipitation increase cannot be the cause of flooding because if it were then there would have been flooding problems in 1973. There were not flooding problems in 1973 because, as it shows in the changes in land area coverage graph, there were 75% natural surfaces and only 13% developed-impermeable surfaces. But now, there are only 45% natural surfaces and 36% developed-impermeable surfaces.  As a result, in 1973 there was more water soaked up by natural surfaces and not as much water just sitting there because of developed-impermeable surfaces. But now, there are less natural surfaces to soak up the water and more developed-impermeable surfaces to leave the water sitting there. So, there is more water sitting at the surface to cause flooding.  This shows that the flooding problems were not caused by increase in precipitation, but by the increase in developed-impermeable surfaces.",4,4,4,4E 404,Science Essay,,,,E 405,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The meteorologist claims that the problem is not impermeable surfaces but increase of precipitation, which is inaccurate. The graph shows that as Developed-impermeable surfaces increase over the years, the natural areas decrease because Developed- impermeable areas are places that humans have created with material that does not allow water to go through it. Also as natural areas decrease, the amount of precipitation increases. I think that this is why the meteorologistsê claim is wrong because as the rain falls, since there is less natural and developed permeable areas for precipitation to sink into, rain builds up in Charleston which is the cause of flooding. If Charleston keeps adding areas that do not allow precipitation, (Developed- impermeable surfaces) then the natural surfaces will decrease as well causing flood levels to go even higher. The town needs more natural surfaces or even developed permeable surfaces. Developed permeable surfaces are areas that humans have created with materials that allow precipitation to sink in.  Once Charleston adds more areas that will absorb precipitation, then there will be less rain to build up and the levels for flooding will decrease.",,,,E 406,"The city of Charleston has been flooding lately and a 7th grade class wants to find out why. The students have been collecting data for a long time, measures of the precipitation tells how much rain and snow the city gets, the amount of rain and snow the city gets has something to do with the flooding problem. The land was divided into 3 categories. The 3 categories  the three categories is things that human kind have created that water canêt go through which means sidewalk, streets ,big tall buildings like sky scrapers or big metal buildings.  Next there are areas that human kind has created for water to go through it/ my hypothesis for those 2 statements is that water is getting into houses and other things because the building material is not strong enough to keep the water out and the more it floods the more the building material on the houses will get weaker. Flooding did not become a problem till 2005. So what I am thinking is that over the years building materials have gotten weaker over the years",0,4,0,0E 407,The meteorologistês argument is inaccurate because in graph 1 it does not show the increase of precipitation. In 1963 the graph shows that the precipitation patterns were about 51 or 52.Then 5 years later the precipitation patterns raised to 59.As the years went by the patterns dropped to about 32 or 33. In 1983 the patterns went up to 41.Then the patterns drooped again over the years. In 1993 the patterns stayed the same for a while but then rose slightly. Then patterns dropped a little.in 2003 the patterns rose and they continued to rise over the years until 2003.  The cause of Charlestonês flooding is not that the precipitation increased over the years. It has something to do with the land that was developed by humans. Over the years the natural areas in Charleston started to disappear because of humans developing the land. As the natural areas went away more developed impermeable surfaces and developed permeable surfaces were being made. There is more developed impermeable surfaces in Charleston. Since there are so many developed impermeable surfaces this caused the floods. This information can be seen in graph 2. ,,,,E 408,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The meteorologist argument is the cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005; flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. The claim is inaccurate because most cities have sewer drainage and sidewalks with holes in them, but then some of those sewers can get full too fast and not drain enough water in time so that can cause flooding. The meteorologist says that developed-impermeable surfaces can cause flooding for the city of Charleston which means if Charleston did not have any sewers then yes that can definitely cause floods, because Charleston had only 13  developed-impermeable surfaces in 1973 but then in 2003 they had 21, thatês not all in 2013 they raised up to 36 which yeah that can cause floods if you have 36 of those if you have too many sidewalks, buildings, and roads then water canêt go through them unless you have a sewer or something to drain water. The meteorologist also said that the flooding did not start until 2005 so when I looked at the graphs I saw that the flooding did not start until around 2003, because thatês when the most precipitation started happening and then it started rising all the way to 60 in 2013. All my evidence supports the claim because if we did not have any information then I would have not had evidence and, or I would not have had proof to say that the claim is inaccurate.",3,2,2,3E 409,"What the meteorologist claimed about the flooding in Charleston Town being caused by heavy amounts of precipitation is incorrect because graph 2 shows that natural land is being stripped away and other man-made materials such and concrete and rock is being placed over it. With the concrete covering all the grass, the water is not able to slip past and goes downhill towards the town.  Graph one does show that precipitation has increased but there was a major drop in precipitation. The precipitation levels have became  higher but so has the developed-impermeable surfaces. I do not believe that the flooding is being caused by the rain. The people of Charleston Town have many developed-impermeable surfaces. The town has also created many developed-permeable surfaces but not a much and developed-impermeable surfaces.  While the people are paving roads along the natural grass and forests, it causes more water  from the rain to flow down to Charleston Town. The amount of precipitation might have increased but so had the developed-impermeable surfaces. I therefor claim that the flooding has increased because of the amount of sidewalks, buildings, and roads built over the past years. The people of Charleston Town have made very few things using grass. Their use of developed-permeable surfaces is very low but has grown over the years. This land could soak up most of the water but since there is so little of the water, the developed-permeable surfaces donêt really do anything to help fight against the flooding.",3,4,4,4E 410,"I think that the Meteorologist is wright because the graph tells me that it has been raining a lot since 1963 to 2013.

I agree with the statement that the Charleston Flood is due to the increase in developed lands with impermeable surface because as you start tearing down trees to build road, houses, and sidewalks, you destroy some defenses to stop the water from come into your city. What I mean by that is the roots from the trees in the natural lands would have took in all that water for the trees. But as you start tearing the trees down, there is not extra help to stop the graph. Because on the graph, it shows that in 1973 that the natural areas were up on 75 while the Impermeable surfaces were at 13. But in 1983, the natural areas slowly started to decrease while the Developed-Impermeable Surfaces started to slowly increase. Then over the next few years, Natural Areas stared to decrease rapidly and Developed-Impermeable Surfaces started to increased. Then by 2013, Natural Areas were at 45 and Developed-Impermeable Surfaces was at 36. Also agree with the claim because Developed-Permeable Surfaces cant be the reason of the flood because the Developed-Permeable Surfaces have been very low during the last 50 years. Developed-Permeable Surfaces started at 12 in 1973 then to 13 in 83 then to 15 in ê93 then 17 in 03ê then finally in ê13, it was at 19.",,,,E 412,"Before 2005 in Charleston was safe and having nun flooding but then it changed and flooded ever since. In the early 1900s, there was a city called Charleston was founded. Floods has never been a problem until 2005 when there floods increased ever since. Students at the school made graph of the amount of floods they have been having. In 1963 there were about 52 floods, 1973 almost 60, 1983 it went lower to about 35 and it kelp going high and low. The students made a different graph about change in land and area and that shows the natural areas, developed-permeable surface and developed-impermeable surfaces. Before 2005 the place was a safe and having nun flooding but then it changed and flooded ever since. People are scared because flooding is dangerous. There land was divided into different part and some part didnêt have a lot of food water or buildings or a lot of things. In the graph Change in land area Coverage in Charleston it shows a lot about how there was a lot of floods and it show how low and high they were. The highest on it the floods in 1973 there were 75 natural areas. Most of the time when it floods like that it mostly happens when a warm and cold are together and it starts to rain a lot. The water cycle goes the water evaporates into the air and to the sun and it starts to rain. In some parts of Charleston there might be a lot of water so it can rain like that. This has led to local flooding in Charleston. ",,,,E 413,BEFORE THE BIG LAND AREAS CHARLESTONêS FLOODING WAS NOT A BIG PROBLEM BUT NOW THAT THEY MADE MUCH MORE LAND THE FLOODINGS ARE NOW HIGH ENOUGH THAT THEY CAN DESTROY THE PROPERTY AND HOMES. I THINK THE METEOROLOGISTS CLAIM IS INACCURATE BECAUSE THE INCREASES IN DEVELOPED LAND ARE WHY THE CITY FLOODS THE METEOROLOGIST THINKS THE RAIN AND SNOWFALL CAUSES THE FLOODS BUT ITêS NOT WHAT CORRECTLY MAKES IT FLOOD NATURAL AREAS ARE THE MOST REASON OF WHY IT FLOODS THE CITYNOT BECAUSE OF RAIN AND SNOW FALL WHEATHER,2,2,3,1E 414,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surface. The Charlestonês flooding problems has been a problem because of sidewalks, buildings, and such more things. Because of that there are so many chances there can be a flood like living by a lake, sea, and ocean, also there may be unfinished sidewalks and sewer pipes are fully finished that can cause a flood. ",,,,E 415,"Why I donêt agree with Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Is because many places have large land but some doesnêt have weather problems, such as flooding. Why I think this is because the towns I been to or cities have flood warnings, but never happened but only sometimes. Like my hometown In Coffeyville, Ks there were a massive flood that had knocked out the gas lines. When the flood had did that we didnêt have any power till help came and gave us some. The people in Coffeyville had to sit on their rooftops till the water had went away, which was a couple of days. I was only 3 years old when it had happened. In social studies we read a book that told us about how the farmers had stopped the flood from ruining their crops. What they did was they had built a barrier to stop the flood from coming near them. But since itês the 2015 they canêt build that, if they did the Charleston would look like China but with smaller walls around. In a paper we read about a small village that was having trouble with floods. The village was very poor and had to crow crops to feed their families. It had flooded a lot there, so what they did was they had made a shed to protect their crops. But what if Charleston couldnêt do that because they may or not be any farmers there. What Charleston could do is go to a safe house, but even if they are there, their houses could get ruined and takes about a couple of months to a year to get their houses fixed. Either Charleston can move all their houses to a place that doesnêt have a lot of floods. But if they did this way it would be a lot of money if they have to buy their house again. If there is a mayor that could buy all their houses with he or hers money, and that could work. What Charleston could do is make big boarded fences, but that could not work. Why because their house could look like the White House but that could be a lot of money to spend on protecting your house? Or if you want to protect your house with boarded fences it could stop trees from growing and plants you may have. The precipitation in Charleston is very a lot which lends to a lot of rain and floods.  What Charleston can do to solve the flooding problem would be to have a river or lake, so the water will go there. Because in the packet it says that Ares that humans have created with materials that do not allow water to go through like sidewalks, buildings and roads. So what Charleston is to do is make a river or lake so when it rains or floods the water will go there and not damage any property?",,,,E 416,"The claim that the local meteorologists presented is inaccurate.  The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is increased precipitation. The annual precipitation data show that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. Therefore, increased precipitation has led to local flooding. The local meteorologistês claim doesnêt really have effect on if something floods due to the type of area that is flooded. From 1973 to about 2003 the area didnêt have many floods, because they were more natural areas that keep the flooding from happening. This happened because the dirt and trees would soak up all the water, therefore it didnêt flood. When the years went by and the natural areas were used for the developed-permeable surfaces and the developed-impermeable surfaces, the woods and trees could not soak up the water any more causing the floods to happen. The claim that Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces, is correct because as the years went by there had become more impermeable surfaces. The more areas they made the more natural areas had to be taken away. This meant fewer trees to soak up the water to cause flooding. They    impermeable surfaces didnêt soak up the water leaving it out in the open to cause flooding. At first it was a good idea to make impermeable surface but as it became more important to build these areas, with the more rain the water was left to flood the area. Which means the second claim; Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. Is correct because the flooding is because of the impermeable surfaces and how they soak up the water like it would if there were still many trees. ",3,4,4,3E 417,"My theory is that Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. I say that the meteorologistês argument, The cause of Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation is invalid. I say this claim is invalid because the meteorologist only took one cause into account that could be effecting the flooding in Charleston. There are two variables that couldêve caused the flooding in Charleston, the increase in precipitation and the increase in impermeable surfaces, but the meteorologist only looks at how the precipitation is effecting the flooding. The meteorologistês claim would only be correct if they had said, recent flooding is the effect of increased impermeable surfaces built in Charleston. This is the main reason of why the meteorologistês claim is invalid. My theory about Charlestonês flooding problem is accurate because the flooding is not only a result of increased precipitation, but also a result of increased impermeable surfaces. To support my claim I say that back in about 1970 the amount of precipitation is actually greater than the amount of precipitation in 2005, which is when the flooding started. If the precipitation was the only problem then flooding wouldêve occurred in 1970 too, instead flooding didnêt affect the city of Charleston. As the precipitation increased so did the number of developed-permeable surfaces in Charleston, therefor water was blocked up more in the city because it could not travel through those surfaces. The amount of natural areas decreased also so there were fewer passageways for water to escape the city. My theory is that increased impermeable surfaces wasnêt letting all the water drain out of the city, so the main reason flooding is occurring is because of increased impermeable surfaces in Charleston. ",,,,E 418,"The cause of Charlestonês flooding is the increase of developed land and impermeable surfaces. The data on graph show that the Developed-Permeable Surfaces have increase over the years and so has the impermiable surfaces. But the natural area has decreased in recent years as the graph shows. This has concerned citizens of Charleston the flooding has cause property damage and can be dangerous. A middle school science class has looked in to the problem and expect it precipitation. They have collected data about the city precipitation over the last 50 years. Measures of precipitation indicate how much rain and snow the city receives. Precipitation in Charlestonês have decreased from 1963 to 1983 and increased from 1983 to 93 and decreased from 93 to 2003 and increased from there. Humans have created sidewalks, buildings, and road and water canêt go through the roads so that could cause less space for the water to go through which in logical terms might cause more flooding. ",,,,E 419,"What I know about water systems is that water goes through a pipe and goes all the way through the city.  So the Charlestonês flooding problem is because of the precipitation, the precipitation data shows that the rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005. Flooding did not become a problem for the city until 2005. I agree with the meteorologist because when they put more land in the city then some land might be bigger than the other land so the smaller land will have more water on the land because the bigger lands water will sink down to the smaller land and the reason why I know this because in 1983 it did not flood that much because they had smaller land but in 2005they added land so now it is flooding that much.",3,2,0,0E 420,"I believe that the city of Charleston has a flooding problem because of the increase in develop land areas with Impermeable surfaces. In 2003 Charleston made a lot of Impermeable surfaces, that is what led to the flooding. Since an Impermeable surface doesnêt let water soak into it, the water has to find somewhere else. The water is either going to go to a Natural area or a Permeable surface because these surfaces allow the water to soak into them like the ground. But once these two surfaces or areas are full they have nowhere else to go but up. This would already cause a little bit of flooding but since the second graph shows us that more impermeable surfaces were made in 2003 than 1973, 1983 and 1993 this would cause more flooding than in previous years. That same graph also shows us that the natural areas were decreasing since 1973.  So since there is a small amount of area that water could fit into and there was the same amount of water being precipitated then the water, like I said before, has nowhere else to go but up. This means that more flooding would happen. When the meteorologist says, Charlestonês flooding problem is the increased precipitation. they are wrong because the increase in precipitation was not the only problem, there was a decrease in the space for the precipitation. This is why I believe that Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces.",,,,E 421,"The city of Charleston started getting bad floods in about 2005. One of the middle schools has been collecting data about the precipitation over the last 50 years. From 1963-2013 the precipitation has gone up and down like in 1963 the rain was about 52 inches. In 1983 the rain was about 35 inches. But in 2013 the rain was back up at 60 inches. In 1973 the developed Impermiable surfaces was at 13, but it has only gone up since then. In 2013 the developed Impermiable surfaces is now up to 36. That shows that the floods have caused so much water to flow in to surfaces that now it is up to 36. The claim that the meteorologist has stated is wrong, because the flooding is due to the fact that the Impermiable surfaces have gone up in the difference of surfaces, that now the flooding has gotten worse because the surfaces are now uneven, so this will cause floods because the surfaces have and it makes the water harder to soak threw so itês filling up on the surfaces causing floods. This proves that the floods are not caused by the massive change in the precipitation. This concludes my statement about the floods in the city of Charleston.  ",3,3,3,3E 422,"This information the citizens of Charleston are worrying about the flooding as it is very dangerous. Some citizens are worrying about property damage. As a effect of this a middle school class is investigating the problem so the students collected the data from the past 50 years and measured the precipitation and the land for different purposes. The reason meteorologistês claim is inaccurate is because they didnêt mention the increased precipitation. The precipitation data shows that rain and snowfall in the area have increased steadily since about 2005 until then flooding wasnêt a problem. Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increase in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The are some precipitation patterns in Charleston such as one in 1963 the precipitation was high in 1983 it lowered and slowly raised until 1993 then down fell again, at 2003 they had their lowest point of precipitation and went way up by 2013. So the pattern for this is lower rise lower rise. There are a few changes in land area coverage in Charleston such as natural areas stayed the highest in the percentage of the different surfaces but the Developed permeable surfaces stayed the lowest the Impermeable Surfaces stayed in between the two. After that we found our pattern the graph was very similar for 20 years then changes then similar for 20 years then changed if this pattern continues the next 20 years should be the same however, they have no proof this will happen with the data we have now it is starting to change a little bit in 2013 the Developed permeable surfaces were higher than ever with the lowest natural areas.",3,2,2,2E 423,"I believe the meteorologist argument is wrong because if the land increases there would not be a lot of floods there. The building always has water go through the ceiling, and that the roads get wet. Humans get hurt and even die from floods so if they have it all the time then the land of people are increases by the time they have floods. There groceryês store are all destroy and all the food so they have to rebuild those stores and houses. They have to make money to build them and get the supplies. If that land keeps on having floods there should not be no more people on that land because they are getting hurt and dying. That land should be band for anyone to go there anymore because it is a waste of money. When they have a flood everything gets destroy and the people have to keep on having to get money or earn money to rebuild everything that got destroy, every time they have a flood. I think that it is not worth it to keep on rebuilding this land over and over when they have a flood. That is why I think the meteorologist argument is wrong.

So the more houses and roads the city builds means that precipitation will increase and more floods will happen. From 2003 to 2013 developed land areas with impermeable have increased by 15% and developed lands with permeable surfaces have barely increased by 2% causing a lot of floods between 2003 and 2013. This is why the meteorologistês claim is inaccurate and Charlestonês flooding problem is due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The solution to this problem is that the city should have more developed land areas with permeable surfaces.",2,3,3,0E 425,The reason why the local meteorologists in Charleston claim is inaccurate because of. First of in the first graph the average of the precipitation is wrong because itês in the 50s most of the time. Second is if itês in the 50s most of the time thatês high and how could they should have a problem because of the floods being at 50ins. Three the only time there shouldnêt be a problem is 1976s to the 2005s also if the said they hadnêt had any problems in the 2005s then how could Charleston starting having problems aging in 2005. Before the 1976s Charleston did have problems with floods then it went down for about 36 years then Charleston started having problems aging after the 2005s and thatês when the floods got worse. Then on the second graph if there is so Meany natural areas there shouldnêt be floods because of the permeable surfaces. That should be able to stop or hold the floods in one place and not let it spread. And then the impermeable surfaces numbers are much lower but that shouldnêt cause a big flood to spread over Charleston.

The chart doesnêt really donêt say anything about how much rain they get or are gong to get.Charleston before were always the same whenever it rained, however until around 2005 whenever rained Charleston would flood and we want to know why. So we got a meteorologist to figure out things.  When he said what he thought was wrong I knew he was wrong about tings. He said that the cause of the flooding is because is the increased precipitation.  ",3,2,3,1F 428,"The growing city of Charleston hadnêt had a problem with flooding in the past, until 2005.  After much hard work, students gathered data and called in a meteorologist to examine it.  The students believed that the flooding problem was caused by a rising rate of impermeable surfaces, but the meteorologist disagreed.  The meteorologist believed that the rising rate of flooding was caused by an increased rate of precipitation.  The meteorologist is wrong, and the students are correct.  The increasing rate of impermeable surfaces in their city has caused more flooding in Charleston. Charlestonês precipitation measurements have never been very stable.  In 1963, the annual average precipitation was about fifty-two inches.  By 1983, the annual average precipitation was about thirty-three inches, and by 2013, it was about sixty inches of rainfall.  There was an increased amount of rainfall, just like the meteorologist said, but that isnêt the only thing that was increased.  The percentage of developed-impermeable surfaces increased throughout the years. Impermeable surfaces are surfaces that do not drain.  In 1973, the percentage of impermeable surfaces was thirteen percent.  By 2013, the percentage had reached thirty-six percent.  If impermeable surfaces do not allow draining, then water would stand on those surfaces.  If there was more rainfall and less draining during those times, flooding would be almost inevitable. The percentage of developed-permeable surfaces had barely went up between 1973 and 2013.  In 1973, the percentage was twelve percent, and by 2013, the percentage had only risen to nineteen percent.  The percentage of natural areas has decreased.  In 1973, the percentage of natural areas was at seventy-five percent, but by 2013, the percentage had dropped to forty-five percent.  All of these developed surfaces, both permeable and impermeable, have been built on the areas that were once natural areas, like forests and parks. The meteorologistês claim that the flooding problems are caused by increased precipitation measurements is false.  The problem isnêt solely caused by increased precipitation measurements.  The developed impermeable surfaces have had a very big act in the problem.  Since these surfaces canêt drain, it causes flooding.  The increased measurements may have added to the problem, but the real problem was the developed impermeable surfaces. ",4,4,4,4F 429,Flooding problems are bad sometimes but are walls can hold it.

After they check over there work soon as they find the right answer they can fix there information that they had the wrong information on.,1,1,2,1F 430,I believe that the flooding in 2005 was because of the sidewalks and things that have been built that will not let water absorbed them. Since 1973 the amount of natural areas have decreased by almost 42%. The meteorologist says itês because of precipitation but it has not increased or decreased but only by a little bit.  Developed permeable surfaces have come up by about 20% as well. The population has grown in the last 10 years. In this time there has been a lot of new buildings and sidewalks and new things built. The students believe that itês because of these things and that we have wasted a lot of just land surfaces. It wasnêt till about 2005 the floods started increasing. This is also when the town of Charleston started in with building and re doing the town. This is obveouiosy the problem because its not letting the water adsorbed to the ground and itês flooding the town. Its pretty much trapping the water about the ground if the blockage wasnêt there then the precipitation would be fine. ,4,4,4,4F 431,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The meteorologists claim that floods were not a problem until 2005. They are incorrect. The graph shows that back in 1963 flooding was a major problem in Charleston.

The meteorologists were somewhat right because in 2005 the percentage went back up to 60 percent. But, they were wrong. There was about a 40-year period where the average went way down.

On the graphs the numbers show that in 1973 only 13% of the land couldnêt  drain water, in 2013 that number spiked to 36% which lowered the amount that could drain water so the city started flooding.",2,3,3,0F 433,Charlestonês flooding problem are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces and tell why the local meteorologistês  claim is inaccurate. I think it wrong because in 2005 it is not the only cause of the floods .because in the 90ês and 80ês and they just about have the same amount of rain in each year . they developed to many imperable surfaces . In 2005 it is not the only cause there are other reasons . ,,,,F 434,"Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces.  An impermeable surface is a structure that doesnêt allow the water to drain effectively in an area.  Roads, service buildings, and houses are all examples of impermeable surfaces.  In the last 40 years Charleston has had a increase in impermeable surfaces. In 1973 75% of Charleston was natural area but since then it has dropped to 45% in the latest data collected in 2013.  Although this number has dropped dramatic, the amount of developed permeable surfaces as risen also.  In 1973 it was at a low 12 percent.  In the year 2013 it is stated to be at 19 percent.  Now you might wonder where the other 13% and 36% from the 2 years lies.  In 1973 there was only 13 percent of impermeable surfaces in the city of Charleston. In the time of development it rose to an exceeding 36%. In 1963 Charleston was getting a average of a little over 50 inches of rain.  That numbered increased until 1973 and then dropped off dramatically to around 34 inches of rain in the year 1983.  From 1983 to 2003 the precipitation stayed lower than 1973.  In 2003 or 2004 the rainfall began to rise dramatically.  The rainfall went clear up to 60 inches of precipitation in 2013. This evidence shows that the meteorologist argument was not supported. I recollect that the reason for the flooding of Charleston is because of the increase in impermeable surfaces being built.  The reason I say this is because in 1973 they had nearly the same amount of rainfall as they do in 2013.  In 1973 there was little problems of flooding.  Now in 2013 there is a great risk of flooding in Charleston.

The main reason is that there are not very many permeable surfaces. Only about nineteen percent of all the land in Charleston is permeable. The claim is inaccurate because there has been just as much rainfall in Charleston in 1963 through 1973 as there has been in 2005 through 2013. I think that the reason that there is so much flooding lately is because there are not as many permeable surfaces now ass there was in 1963. I think that if Charleston put more of those draining surfaces in that most of the flooding will stop. Also if there are any rivers, creeks, or ponds near by Charleston that could be a big factor to in the flooding. Maybe the levies are bad and they need fixing. Or maybe the sewage is backed up and the drains on the side of the road are not working like they should. That is what I think the reason there have been so many floods in Charleston lately. The meteorologist is very inaccurate and maybe the childrenês data is wrong.

The real reason the flooding has happened is because of all the run off water that comes off houses and streets causing it to gather in one place.

The meteorologist is wrong because it had the same amount of rain in 1963 till1970. In 1963 to 1970 the city of Charleston had over 50 inches of rain. In 2005 to 2013 Charleston has had over 50 inches of rain. Those seven years are equivalent to these past 8 years. In 1973 the city of Charleston only had 13 percent impermeable surfaces.

Charleston did not have this flooding problem that is seen today, so the flooding has been caused by something other than precipitation patterns.The next issue that the class came up with was the changes in land area coverage. In between the year of 1963 and 1973 there was a very high amount of natural areas and very little developed-impartible areas. In the last fifty years the natural areas have steadily decreased while the developed-impartible areas increased. Coupled with the rain has caused more flooding then what they have ever seen.",3,2,4,2F 442,(no content),,,,F 443,Flooding has been happening way before 2005 itês been way before then. But the reason why it floods is because it keeps raining so it increases on the water going up even higher than it already was then when it gets so high the levy gets heavy and then it just breaks. It will hurt a lot off people they will lose ever thing they had in there because they didnêt know it was coming farmers will lose all of there crops farm stuff animals every thing they had and worked really hard for. In 1973 75 of the natural area was flooded by the water you see that was so high up with all the flooding that the develop-permeable surfaces was like at 12 and the develop-impermeable surfaces was at 13. See they where so low because people thought it wasnêt going to happen but it really was ten some people where trying to say they did know about when they really didnêt see we donêt have a flooding problem at all its just that it wont quit raining so the water is getting higher and higher and we cant stop it. See the more and more we go down the graph the farther and farther down the water goes. Yes where never was a problem in the city but it all happened because we got so close to the water and there was probably a real close by river then that probably got so high it just broke then it got the city and flooded it all out. Yes the flooding did increase but its not local that it will keep flooding in the city it mite not flood there anymore you never know. But they keep having rain your to keep on having flood but you cant stop. But it rained and rained and rained and it never flooded here untell now so they must have had to done something to make it flood. ,,,,F 444,(no content),,,,F 445,"Charleston is wrong/right, there is a lot of rain, but in 1964 they had the same amount. I think the meteorologist is wrong about his statement, he claims the perception is to blame but what the evidence really shows is it the urban land increase. See if you look at the rain in 1964 and 2013 they are the same but in 1964 they wasnêt getting flooded. I believe that the problem is the increase of developed-Impermiable Surfaces. The rain is losing land to get soaked up in. The decrease in Developed-Permeable Surfaces is also to blame. As you see, they deceased A LOT! The rain isnêt getting soaked up, there so it stays around and sits there.  From the evidence you can see itês a combination of both of the factors. That needs to be accounted for and Counter acted.

They have to much Developed permeable surfaces.,,,,F 447,"The meteorologistês claim is inaccurate.  The city had increased rain in 1963, but had no flooding problems.  Also the flooding didnêt start until the increase in developed land areas in 2005. Each year natural areas and developed-permeable surfaces have decreased, while at the same time developed-impermeable surfaces have increased.  These are reasons that could lead to the flooding of Charleston. The city had increased rain in 1963.  In this year, there was no flooding but increased precipitation.  The only other factor in the flooding was development.  In 1963, there was only 13% of developed-impermeable surfaces in the city of Charleston.  The rest of the land in Charleston was either natural or developed-permeable. The flooding increased drastically, to happening every time it rained, in 2005.  The development of developed-impermeable surfaces increased drastically.  In 2003, the amount of impermeable surfaces was already up to 21%.  Then in 2013, it went drastically up to 36%.  The flooding is increasing due more to the increase in impermeable surfaces than rain amount. Each year the amount of natural areas and developed-permeable surfaces have decreased, while at the same time developed-impermeable surfaces have increased.  If water doesnêt have any where to go itês going to cause flooding.  Impermeable surfaces donêt allow water any place to go. They trap water in place and donêt allow it an escape.  Natural areas and permeable areas allow water a place to go.  The water can seep into the ground.  If impermeable surfaces are going to continue to grow then there needs to be somewhere for the water to go.  The city of Charleston can make channels for the water to be directed elsewhere. Otherwise, they will continue to be flooded.",,,,F 448,Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. The main reason why the meteorologist is wrong is because the area has gotten that much rain before and it did not flood. The city has gotten more populated and more buildings are around now than 1963. This will cause the city to be more prone to flooding.  ,3,2,4,2F 449,"Before they put up sidewalks and hi-ways the natural areas let water goes in the ground, in streams and in rivers.

He is also wrong about it because the land has decreased not increased.  They are flooding because there getting a lot of farm land and they are losing everything else.

I think the past three years it has just rained more then others.  I think they need to change the way they expand and expand away from the flooding areas.

My claim is more correct because if you look at the graphs the building of impermeable surfaces has gone up and is almost even with Natural areas. The permeable surfaces are very low and are only at 19%. The impermeable surfaces are at 36% and the natural areas are at 45%. There arenêt a lot of areas for the water to drain off because the natural and impermeable areas are almost even and the permeable areas are so low.

Increases precipitation is, and will not be, an issue for flooding.  The water and snowfall must have some place to drain into.  You cannot expect water to disappear on its own.  The town should build a run off, or something like it, for the water to flow to.  There is more water flowing through the water cycle than the cycle can draw off, therefore you must have a place for the water to go until it will go away. Human activity can also cause flooding.

But itês how the people are treating the environment and just keep taking down lands that we donêt need and building dumb non-buildings that we need. Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces because people like the government or whoever let construction sites build random buildings to get money off people.  The more buildings are put up the more of the flood happens and increases.  Most buildings are running water off into just random land areas and causes floods to develop over time.

Without all the land for the water to absorb into, the water has nowhere to go, causing the floods. The meteorologistês claim was incorrect.

Since 2005, when it began increasing again is when the floods were appearing more often. Around 2005 is also when we began seeing less natural areas for the precipitation to drain.

Also the chart shows that the  Developed-Impermiable  Surfaces were made the most in between 2003 and 2013. So if the flooding got worse at around 2005 then it was probably because the surfaces changed the most at around that time.  So it makes more sense that the flooding is from Charlestons increase in developed land areas, rather than the reason being precipitation. So the final conclusion is that the meteorologist was wrong, because the precipitation was not the reason that there was flooding. Since they changed the surfaces so much no water could go through because it was made with materials that water cant go through.

Another problem is that in 2003 the developed_permeable surfaces was at 17 and now at 19 now that might help us a little but we had to cut down trees which suck up the water which causes the flooding. The last problem is that we have a lot more developed-imperiable surfaces that make it hard for the ground to soak up all the water. That make the water stays on the surface and that causes flooding.

Data also shows that in 1973 the amount of natural areas was greater than they are now in 2013. In 1973 the developed impermeable surfaces was less than in 2013.

The developed-permiable surfaces are rising, but they are still not helping the situation.  Also, most of the ground in Charleston cannot absorb the water, leaving most of it on sidewalks, buildings, and roads.  This could mean Charleston could receive less rain than in 1988, but be almost completely flooded.

The local meteorologistês claims, that it is due to an increase in precipitation, are false. She/he didnêt look into all of the information provided on the issue.  She/he only looked into the data of the amount of precipitation.  However, there are other factors that have built up to cause this flooding problem. One of the main factors as to why his/her claim is false because there was also an increase in precipitation 30 years ago.  The precipitation levels in 1973 were about the same as they are now.  There was not a flooding problem back then.  The problem didnêt occur until 2005.  Therefore, the increase in the amount of precipitation alone cannot be the cause of the problem. Between the years of 1963 and 1973, when the amount of precipitation was about the same, there werenêt as many developed-impermeable surfaces as there are now.  Nowadays, with impermeable surfaces mixed in with the amount of precipitation this has become a problem.  This is the reason as to why we are having such a flooding problem.  About 30-40 years ago there were more natural areas, unaffected by man.  With so many developed properties there is not natural way for rainwater to escape. Thus, causing the increase with the flooding problem. With natural areas, rainwater could naturally, easily escape.  The way it was intended too.  With more areas being built and developed by man, there is so escape route for this rainwater.  We ourselves are creating this problem.  The precipitation increase is a part of the problem, but is not the only reason.  It is also mixed in with the increase of developed-impermeable surfaces.  If we can find easier ways to let rainwater escape, we can find a solution to our problem.   We need to develop better water systems unless weêd like to return to having more natural areas and get rid of our urban areas.  ",,,,F 479,"Charleston has recently encountered a problem that they have never faced before.  Within recent years every time it rains the city of Charleston would flood.  One Charleston middle school decided they wanted to try and figure out what is causing all of the flooding in their town.  They then collected data of the rainfall from the past 50 years and also what type of land the city was made up of.  Then they asked a local meteorologist to give his opinion on why he thought the city of Charleston was flooding.  The meteorologist said that Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in precipitation.  He claimed that the rain and snowfall have increased steadily since 2005 when the flooding originally started.  Therefore, increased precipitation has led to the local flooding. It is my own opinion that the meteorologistês claims are wrong.  I do not think that the local flooding is cause from increased precipitation.  Charlestonês flooding problems are due to the increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. In 2005 the rain and snowfall did start to steadily rise, but that is not what caused all the local flooding.  In 1973 the annual average precipitation was just as high as it is today but there was no flooding.  The true cause of all the flooding is due to their being more developed-impermeable surfaces. Back in 1973 only 13% of the land was impermeable.  That number has more then doubled and now 36% of all the land is impermeable.  The rain not being able to sink into the ground is whatês causing all the local flooding.   ",3,3,4,2F 480,"The meteorologist has inaccurately stated that the flooding is due to the increased precipitation. This is inaccurate because the flooding is caused by human developments. By humans building more and more on the natural areas the precipitation has no where to be absorbed. The paved roads, parking lots, sidewalks, and added buildings on what was once natural land has caused the water to be retained instead of being absorbed into the ground. By the town growing and beginning to need more and more paved areas the ground available to soak up the precipitation is being sealed over with a material that is impermeable, meaning that water cannot pass through it.How the population has grown has affected the natural areas and permeable surfaces as shown in the graphs. If the amount of precipitation was the cause of the flooding then in the 1960ês to the 1970ês the town would of flooded due to the same amount of precipitation as in 2005 and up as shown in graph 1. The town didnêt flood at this time though because there were more natural and permeable surfaces that could soak up the water; therefore prevent any flooding. After 2005 the permeable surfaces compared to the impermeable surfaces were shrinking. The only way that Charleston can prevent the flooding now is to make drainage passages in their roads and other paved impermeable surfaces in order to redirect the precipitation into an area that is permeable. A natural area or a soccer field would be good examples of possible run off areas. After this is done the town should no longer flood because the water will be able to be absorbed into the ground.",,,,F 481,"I think I have to disagree with what the meteorologist has argued.

If you look at the data given about the average precipitation from 1963-2013, then you would notice that the meteorologist missed something. The precipitation in the years in between 1963 and 1973 are almost as high as in the year 2013.  2005 didnêt have nearly as much precipitation as in 2013, so itês safe to say that the precipitation was higher in those years between 1963 and 1973. If it was higher in the past, then why is there flooding now? Look at a second set of data, given about changes in land area coverage in Charleston. Look at the land area in 1973. 87 percent of the land is permeable. Only 13 percent isnêt.  Notice how over the next years, until 2013, the amount of permeable surfaces decrease as the impermeable surfaces increase. As the precipitation increased again, as on pattern with the past, the land isnêt able to naturally drain the water, causing flooding. So I would more accurately say that the cause for flooding is actually due to increases in developed land areas with impermeable surfaces.",3,3,4,3F 482,"In the last ten years, Charlestonês amount of flooding has increased dramatically. Each time it rains heavily, all the rain floods Charleston. We are concerned that all the flooding in Charleston will cause property damage and just be a dangerous place to live in. The local meteorologist near our school argued that the amount of snow and rainfall causes Charleston to flood easily but I disagree with him. This is what I think about what happened with Charleston and what causes the flooding to happen more and more here. The meteorologistês claim is inaccurate because the amount of rain in the cityês beginnings was about the same amount as the amount of rainfall we have today. In Graph 1: Precipitation patterns in Charleston, we see in the beginning that the amount of rain was about 60 inches. In the graph, we see nearly the same amount as in the 1970ês. In the 70s, we didnêt see as much flooding as in our present time.  So, the meteorologist was definitely inaccurate. I think the cause of flooding in Charleston is increase for developed land areas with impermeable surfaces. This is my reasoning behind it. In the last 50 years, we see a steady incline of urban areas in our town. The urban area in Charleston causes less of the ground to soak up the water. This means the water will slide off the road into the grass causing it to soak up less than what the ground needs. This would cause massive flooding and the whole town to be flooded.",,,,F 483,"The claim that Charlestonês flood problem is from increased precipitation is inaccurate. It is inaccurate because It states in the graphs that their has been flooding a while back too. So that means that the increased precipitation would have had to been there for a while, and the rain wouldnêt of just stood overhead. It would of moved on after it was already flooded.  Another fact states, in  2013 it was 36% of Developed Impermiable Surfaces so less than half would of stayed on the ground. Now that it is 2015 the 36% might of increased or decreased depending on what they have done, or what they have not done. Also another reason is, in order to be a powerful storm it would have had to started in Charleston or a town close by and moved on from their in any direction. Or it could of started of slow and got stronger by the time it hit Charleston. Depending on which one it is it had to of got really strong by the time it hit Charleston. This proves that his assumption is very inaccurate.",1,1,2,0F 484,(no content),,,,,,Analyze,Explaination,Critque,Argument
