Research Questions
•	Can a machine learning computational linguistics based model accurately predict coder scores on a written response to an argumentation prompt? 

•	How and to what extent can I assess student argumentation from written answers to student prompts?

o	Standard computational linguistics versus Rose C’s framework 

•	How robust are the argumentation assessment computational models across domains? (school prompt) 

•	How and to what extent do students instructed by teachers who have been through augmentation training develop argumentation skills at a high rate? 


Literature as it is now- 
	Transforming Biology Assessment with Machine Learning: Automated Scoring of Written Evolutionary Explanations, Nehm, R.H., Ha, M. & Mayfield, E. J Sci Educ Technol (2012) 21: 183.
	Machine learning of assessing argument responses within a math social setting. Rose et al.  (Sean has pdf) 

Gap- Although machine learning has been used in science to assess student responses to test questions it has not been used to assess the quality of various NGSS practices, analyzing data, explaining a phenomenon, critiquing an argument, or advancing a claim. ML has been used to assess collaborative argumentation generation in a math classroom. Individual responses in a science classroom have yet to be investigated. 

Methods – We will take 212 responses of the NGSL Charleston that have already been assessed and scored using our NGSL rubric and use them as training data to create a computational linguistic machine-learning model that can predict a score that is in line with our rubric. When then will assess the reliability of the model on the other 212 responses to see if the model has a sufficient Kappa score.
